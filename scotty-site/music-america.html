    <p>Created in the last week before I moved away from Boston to New York.<br>

    I like this album. I like how it sounds,<br>
    We did it on Colin’s Tascam Portastudio 424 MKiii.<br>
    We had a lot of fun making it.<br>
    We made a music video for hit single “We Fucked”.</p>
  
    <p>“4.25/5” - RateYourMusic</p>
  
    <p><em>“This week’s new release we have the dirty and revolting sounds of the ever entertaining four-track band American Ninja Warriorz whose second record of the year harbors critiques of Boston’s affected and rapidly gentrified DIY scene while preserving the band’s fuck-shit stylings and gung-ho songwriting approach (see Berklee Bitch Boyz and Deth to Shoegaze).”</em><br>
