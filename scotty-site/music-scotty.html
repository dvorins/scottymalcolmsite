    <p>Scotty’s debut album. Created in his hippie era. Some of the songs were written alongside Melody Trautner.</p>
    <p>“4.0/5” - RateYourMusic.com</p>
    <p>Included in a list entitled <a href=https://rateyourmusic.com/list/juder/101-diy-albums-you-must-hear-before-you-die/2/">“101 DIY Albums you must hear before you die”.</a> ‘Juder’ says, “Scotty is a visionary… indie pop to heal the soul and clear the mind… fantasy and reality... intertwining. Listen while munching on leaves.”</p>
    <p>A music video was made for this album for the single, “Mirror Man”. Watch the video. I was 19, I have changed since then. I am now 23. A lot has changed in 4 years. Nino Aiyer played drums on most songs. Eoin played bass on maybe 1 or 2 songs. Mogi Taylor played sax on 2 songs I think. Album mixed and mastered by Justin Kao.</p>

    <p>Created in 1 week in Nashville in collaboration with Rick West at Rick’s house. Recorded on 8 track cassette. Sweet album. It’s nice.</p>

    <p>This was a computer album also. Created in Nashville with Rick. We made it in 2 weeks I think. It was really fun to make.</p>
    <p>The first time I drank coffee was when we made this album and I immediately fell in love with coffee. I loved coffee for years but now it makes my body feel weird so I drink tea.</p>

    <p>Album art by Harrison Wyrick. Released by net label Birthdiy. Created in the summer. I made a double music video for the songs “Dog” and “Emma vs. The Homework Monster”.</p>
    <p>“If Scotty Malcolm has a million fans, then I am one of them. If Scotty Malcolm has 10 fans, then I am one of them. If Scotty Malcolm has only one fan then that is me. If Scotty Malcolm has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. If the world is against Scotty Malcolm, then I am against the world.” - @mae7736</p>
    <p>“Came across this on a discover weekly, and it seems like a pretty blatant rip-off of Arthur Shea's solo work but it's still fun nonetheless..” …..6/10 - ahrin</p>

    <a href="https://happentwice.com/product/scotty-malcoms-double-album-extravaganza-cassette/"><strong>DOUBLE ALBUM EXTRAVAGANZA (2023)</strong></a>
    <p>This was a compilation tape released by the label HappenTwice. It combined my albums Arthur Flowers: Elf Rock and A Crazy: Named Man. I don’t know how many were created, maybe 25 or 50? I think they are all gone now.</p>

    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7tecOsLi1tsqzwj6PKopr0?si=qRkOhnFRQXGNYVsCaMTi2A"><strong>RAT BASTARD (2023)</strong></a>
    <p>Just had some songs I made that year. I was busy attending college and becoming smarter. Thought I’d release these songs because I hadn’t released anything for a year. Loosely based on the idea of my alter ego, “Rat Bastard,” who is evil and hates me and takes over my brain and sabotages my life. No one really listened to this one, I didn’t promote it much. It’s okay.</p>
