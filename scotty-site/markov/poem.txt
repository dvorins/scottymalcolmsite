Evil baby,
​ Evil
story)

​ ​ ​

(for the sake of the

The Exorcist
I arise to my stomach collapsing
upon the mercy of Chinese chicken
child of the floor, lord of the porcelain
She holds me, she knows the fear in my eyes
Satan himself courses through my butthole
i push like never before, nothing comes
My love walks through the door, she is the light
I declare, the power in Christ compels you
Blast off, a force so powerful lifts me
I fly among the angels, spewing vile
Slowly the devil peters out of me
My fuel is empty, I fall through the sky
I land in a kingdom of clouds, heaven.

The Meaning of Life
I started to grow tired, searching for it,
Contemplating my reason to exist.
I remember, sitting on that park bench,
And it just came to me, what I must do.
I think I'll just spend my life killing squirrels.
I'll kill them all if I have enough time.
And if I don't, at least I'll stay busy,
And Mom will be proud I stuck to something.

Last Nite
I started to cook myself a burger,
and then the pan started yelling and it
got real angry, and then i remembered
that one time when i was making some eggs,
I picked up the pan, and it drowned in flames
I stood there with my tail between my legs,. ,
And my Roommate threw it out the window
before i could decide whether or not
To just sit back and watch everything burn.
First ever poem I ever wrote cuz I jus wanted to
I started to drink some wine and then I
Started to remember why I felt sad
And so I poured some more but then I fell
Deeper and I started to feel myself
Falling through space and I could do this thing
Where I think about nothing and it feels
Real good so I keep doing it until
I starttoo feel bad and then I walked home.

Hair
You asked
Me if I thought
It looked gay
And so
I told you i didn’t
Think it was gay.,
And i wondered if
You asked cuz you
Hated yourself or
Something,
But
You said you
Asked cuz
Some
Guy, in a
Session
Said you had
The
Most lesbian haircut he had
Ever seen
And you did’
nt like that and i do
nt think i would either
And you said
He t3xted you to
EXPLAIN that it wasnt bad
That It looked
Gay,
And you told me about
How
You dressed like a boy now,
And i liked that about
You but
I wonder
ed what you dressed like before,.
And the n i started to
Imagine you
With a mohawk and
You were real cool like
And it
Reminded me
Of this character

From LEGO ROCK BAND and
Then i started to feel
Sad about Sam’s story how
He got rock band for
Christmas, but they couldn’t afford the
Guitars,
And they tried
So
HArd to play with
A controller
But you couldn’t,.
You just
Couldn’t,/
So they took it back
To the store and his
Christmas present went back
Through the door
And now that I think of it
he's got a real good head of hair
I like his
I don't
Like mine much
But there’s a lot
I like about
Him that I don’t
Like about me and
There's a lot of stuff I think that falls
Out of my brain through
My hair and
I wondered if you could just
See
it
And maybe
That's why i seemed so unfriendly
But i liked it most
When
It looked
Real bad
And I felt
Real
Bad,.
Because maybe i could be
A cool guy in a corner
And
someone would
Notice me .and you did.

And i looked at that hair
Of yours ,before you ever asked if I thought
It was
Gay
And all I thought was
That it looked
Real
Cool.

Feather
I told her I couldn’t smoke
American Spirits cuz they
Gave me allergies and
Made my
Throat
Itchy and she asked
If it
Was cuz of those
Eagle feathers
They throw in there
And i thought to myself
Maybe I am
Just allergic
To america

Curb
I ride off you on my bicycle
And it makes me feel like a man
When I stand partially up on my bike and
Try to do a little jump.
Once I complete this jump I join the street
And your purpose it fulfilled.
I wonder if you ever feel unfulfilled when
You hangout in a lonely town
And there's no hipster bitch boy
To listen to his earbuds
And go up and down you.
And maybe you get a little evil
And all that dirt n shit you collect,
You focus all of it onto one point for yours,
Carefully curating the perfect trap
One day a pregnant lady trips off that point
Crushes her little baby and you rejoice
You're sick in the head but
Can I blame you?
Maybe you earned a little darkness
For all of your unwavering righteousness
Of never leaving where you came from.
But you must.
And I can't bear to watch you die there.
So I buy a lightsaber and chop you off and now
I carry you around with me
Because I thought you deserved the world
But you didn't want it.

Berklee Bitch Boy 1
I feel such a desire to stick out
I use to hide like a
Dumb little
Pig
But now,
I just get high and hate
Myself.
I need to try some new drugs;
Ketamine
It’s gonna make me so weird and
jaded.
Then I will make
Twisted drawings and songs
People will revere me,
I will be king

It’s such a foolish thing
To be king.
Yet,
Nothing I do is ever enough
I will never be satisfied
With
Life.
The moments I am are always
Fleeting.
What if

I don’t want to use fancy words?
Would it be enough
If I
Just used the truth?
I am sure that I will cringe
At this
Poem.

I try my best
To hold to
My
Ego.

My ego and
My
Self
Worth are
So Involved.
Without one,
The other
Doesn’t
Exist.

I am a Berklee Bitch Boy,
Here me now.

Machete
There’s a machete hanging
On my wall.
I wonder
If I’ll ever use it
I think I’m gonna buy a
Pineapple.
And I will run the motions a
Little.
I will slice the
Poor fool
In half.
And I will eat
4 to 5 pieces
And after,
I will leave it
To rot.

Walking the Prank
Why do we
Need to feel
Important?
I would feel so
Free,
If I could accept
That I don't matter,
That nothing matters.
The meaning of life
Is Propaganda, to keep me
Hooked,
On the algorithm.

I think I just need one more video
About
Why
Sydnee Sweeney is
Canceled.
Then I’ll go on with the rest of my
Life.
And I’ll be satisfied in my
Solitude.

Nightly Routine
Satisfaction is so
Easy to
Find.
But,
Happiness is so far
From here.

They once told me,
They were
The same
Thing.
But I guess they were
Lying.

I think I'll just jack off,
And go to sleep.

Girlfriends
I am a
Baby.

Please,
Smother me with your love,
And tell me,
What
To do.

Heart of a Wolf…
I got a devil in my soul and
He likes to say
Edgy things

But,
I got a angel in my
Eyes
And he feels bad
For everything.

She’s an Artist
Yknow,
She's a real
Artist
And I feel like an
Artist when
I think of her., and
I look at this picture and
I think of her
Beautiful mind.
She just so

Effortlessly interesting
I wonder
If I am too.,
But I think she tries
And I think I do
Too.
But there are
Some things,
That you just
Can’t help.

Anonymous
I changed my mind about you
And I thought you
Were a
Dick,
But I think
I was insecure
And I think you’re
Insecure and you
Play it off in such
An interesting
Way.
And I wonder if I
Ever do the
Same thing.,

I think I don't,
But I’ve come to realize your
A good lad and
You’re just another person
And I’m
Sorry that one
Time I thought about
If I had to kill a Berklee friend
Who
Would it be
And I thought
Of
You.

Guns
I grabbed my phone in
The morning once
I woke up
And I started to
Watch these gun restoration
Videos.

And these guns would be destroyed
And they’d fix them
Right
Up.

But all the guns looked the same
Chipped and rusted
And someone in the comments
Said that they
Buy the guns new.//.,,.then
Destroy
Them
And then fix
Em up after that
And it reminded me
Of someone

Boy in class
Juxtaposition is such a
Cool and impressive word
And you are a swag
Monster.
I wannoo dangle on those
Hoops of yours and pull
Them out your ur ears
Boy.

Necklace
I think he has
A crush

And I think I can smell this girl
And I miss good
Smelling girls, but
One time I dated one
And I grew
So sick of the smell.
Do you find me disgusting?
Absence of love
Is floating.
Absence of love
Is
Emptiness.
White light is love
Do you find me disgusting?

Arrow
Ey fools,
Pass me dat arrow.
Ima shoot this clown in the
Face and eat his fingernails
For dinner.
You wanna know somethin?
Sometimes I shoot arrows straight in to the
Sky and just stand there
Like in Grownups; to see
If
The world still want me to
Keep going.

Guyz Nite
I should’ve gone

Dancing with you.
But it was
Guyz
Nite
And it was beautiful
​
We got to the cusp
Of admitting our feelings
​
In between turns
Of
Catan.
And Luca even told
Nathaniel
He looked beautiful tonight.
And the whole
​
Nite was
Beautiful.
​
But don’t think
I don’t
​
Wish I could’ve
​
Spent it with
​
You
Too.
My Novel
I tried
To write
My novel tonight
But I wrote about
3 pages,
Then I got tired of it
And I checked if that
Girl
Wants to give me a
blow job tonight.
And I realized it
Takes a lot of
Patience to write a
Book.
Cigarettes

I promised myself I wouldn’t,
Cuz my throat hurts.
But,
I really wanna,
And it’s such a gross thing,
To write a
Poem about cigarettes,
But here I am,
Disgusting myself,
Once again.

Magician
To be a magician would
Be great
I’d like to be a real one.
I would never have to worry
About anything,
Because any time I needed to impress someone
I would just use my powers and
They would be amazed.
No matter what,
My spells would always be there
For me.
But,
If I was cursed and I watched my powers
Slowly
Fade
​
Out
That would be the worst way
To die.
If I couldn’t just pull something out
Of the back of my pocket anymore to
Impress someone.
And the more I search for the rabbit
In my hat,
The further it falls
And If I look down the

​
Hole,
I just see darkness,
I scream
​
Into my hat., but
No one can
​
Hear me inside of my
Uniform.
So,
I adopt the cloth of a wizard,
A close cousin of mine,
But it doesn’t fit right,
I tug at the sleeves and
Sag the pants.
Still,
​
Nothing comes.
So I throw it all away,
And
I accept the life of a mortal.
But, I hold onto the
Tiniest spark at all times as
A reminder of what I
Thought I could
Be.
But it just makes everything
Worse.
I remember when it was
So easy,
And
​
I would just do tricks for them and
They’d do it right back at
Me.
And maybe I’ll go digging for that old hat
Of mine.
It was never supposed to be easy.
But,
​
IF YOU TRY TO HARD,
The magic has a way,
OF ,
Hiding. So

You just sit there
And wait
For
It.
You try
So
Hard,
Not to care,
And you are
Lost.
So you give up again
And decide to be a cowboy.
Being a cowboy ain’t so
Bad,
​
It’s not about tricks,
It’s about,
Being bold.
And that’s always come easy
For you.
And maybe one day you’ll combine them.
No one will know why
You always win
But you got a magic gun
And you may not always
See it., but,
​
Why do you need to keep
Seeing it
When it’s revealed itself
Time and again.
And when will you start
To Believe.

A BOY
YELLED IN MY CLASS
TODAY

AND RAN OUT,
THEM CAME
BACK AND
BEGAN CRYING,
THEN CALLED HIMSELF
THE VILLAIN
AND STARTED
YELLING
AND
CRYING
ONCE
AGAIN/
SOMETIMES I FEEL
BAD.
LEAST I AIN’T
THAT
BAD.

7 People
I texted​
7 people
Tonite,
​
​
For potential
Hangouts,
Nothing
​
Yet.
God
I’m so desperate
I’m such a
Bitch.
I’m bored,

People entertain me.
Wine entertains me,
So I bought some
More.
I figure,,,.
If I drink enough
Then
Maybe
Tonight
I’ll be able
To
Love those songs
I made earlier,
And then,
I could
Love myself.

Frickwest
I saw you
Online on
Fortnite
And I invited
You
To my party,
Nothing…
And I called,
Nothing…
When will it ever be

That I
Give you
Nothing
And you
Give me
Something.
Tired
Man,
I sure find this
Poetry thing,
A bit
Exhausting.
I’m not sure,
How long
I’ll keep it going.
​
Maybe I’ll work random
Jobs and
Write
In my free time,
But,
If I ever start
To make some
Real
Money,
I’m sure this,
And anything else
About me,
That's good,
That's interesting,
I’ll leave it all behind,
Cuz,
If you got money, you don’t
Need that sort of
Thing.
Call
Girl I sure
Wish

You’d call,
And I know,
Your real
Busy up there in
California land,
But I
Can’t help but
Think about you,
And that bitch boy that
Comes round you,
Aaron,
And I’d sure love to beat
Him
And I’d love
You
To watch
And maybe I’ll just
Kill him
So I don’t have to
Worry about
Him,
Professing his love
Again.
And you,
Being drunk enough
To care.

40 Pages
I made it
To 40 pages, and
You’re allowed to
Congratulate me
On my genius now,
If you so
Desire.

And if you made it this far,
Yeah,
You.
Sorry there were a couple
Weird ones,
Involving you,
But thinking of you
Kept me writing
And thanks
For being
My
Muse.
And I’d like
To say,
Anything that I did
Or said
Was completely
False.
And all
For the sake
Of the Story.

Poop
I went to the
Bathroom
And opened
The toilet
And I saw
A huge
​
Poop.
And I don’t remember
Doing
It,
​

And I’m the only one
Home.

And I wonder if
Some
Villain
Came in here,
Took a shit,
And left his mess
​
For me
​
To clean up
Once again.

New Songz
I wrote
Some songs
This week; but
I got the
Feeling they might
Be cringe and
Not very good,
So I’ll make some more
And maybe
Then I’ll make
A great one
So I can
Feel better.

Grocery Shopping
I weny
Outside,
Walking today
For
The first time
In about
3 days.
I went outside
A couple other times
To smoke cigarettes
And once,
I walked a
Lil,
To buy boxed wine.
I been staying inside,
Loosing my
Mind.
And it’s been
Great and
Its
Been
Awful,
I made some songs
And wrote
Some poems
And it
Feels like anytime
I wanna
Make
Something,
It’s important that
I seclude
Myself and
Go a little
Crazy.

For better or worse.

To
Feel so good
In here,
And
Now I gotta start
Something
New,
I don’t know what
To bring to
New york tmrw,
I got a lil
Book,
But sometimes
It doesn’t
Feel right,
When it’s
Not a book
Like this,
This one is like my wife,
Now,
I leave you.

8:35 pm

I don’t
Got much
To
Say
Right now,
But I don’t
Feel like
Doin much
Besides
Drinking wine
And writing
Poems,
But if
You were here,
I’d drop
It all
For you in
A second.
And I can’t stop
Thinking
About
Your
Beautiful face
You r
Beautiful mind
Your
Beautiful mind
And I can’t wait till u get back.
New Journal
I was
Deciding
Which to get.
There was
A thin
PURPLe
One

A thick GREEN
ONE
A THICK BLACK
ONE.
I decided on
The black,
Cuz I’d like
To have
One
For a long time,
And I’m currently
Feeling
Emo.
Genius
It sure
Keeps
Me going
When you call
Me
A
Genius.
I could almost
Jack off
To
That
Text.
You should
Whisper it in
My ear,
WHEN;
We have sex.
Sex
My penis
Protecx me,

It only allows
Me
To
Fuck
Those I love,
Those I trust,
Those who
Love
Me;
If it don’t check
All 3
He will hide;
And believe me,
We ain’t on
Good
Terms cuz
It,
But ,
I think he’s
Just lookin
Out for me,
And I hope,
I pray,
He’ll let me
Fuck
you.

Sharing
I’ve come
To realize
Its best
To share
Nothing
Because
In that small
Time

Where I make
Something
And
Share it,
While I may
Feel it’s
Shit;
It’s still up for
Interepretation
Whether
Or not;
It is a
Masterpiece.
HUNGRY
I BEEN
SO ​
HUNGRY
LATELY
I EAT
CIGARETTES
AND
ADDERALL
AND I
DRINK WATER AND
WINE
AND IT
FEELS
IT
TASTES
SO GOOD,
BUT I FEEL MYSELF
SLOWLY

DYING
AND I HOPE
SOMETHING
WILL
MAKE
ME
FEEL
SOMETHING
AGAIN.

Picture of You
Before I go,
I just remembered,
I just
Taped a
Picture of
You
Into my old
Journal;
And i might
Have to
Move it;
Cuz now to
Look AT you
I’ll have to
Venture thru
The
Archives.
YES
I
AM
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
COOKING
THE BURGER
AND I
AM SO
EXSCITED
I ATE IT
DAMN.
THAT
WAS SO
GOOD.
I COULD EAT
ANOTHER.

I LOST IF FUCK IT
Greyhound
I missed
My bus
This morning.
I was texting
You and
I was too
Lazy
To get
Out of bed.
I was starting
Today when
You were
Still ending

Yesterday.
I got on another
Bus to
Chinatown.
I’m so hungry,
Maybe I’ll eat
Some
Chinese food,
Though I’m
Not
Sure if I’m in
The mood.
Heal Me
I’m so
Tired
And I feel
Pretty,
Bad,
I drink this
Water
And pray
It heals me.
And if it does,
I promise
I will
Be nice
To my body
Now.
But I get
The feeling
That
That
Is
A lie,
And once I start
To get a bit better,
I’ll just do it
All over
Again.

Attention
You like it
When I write
About
You.
You said I’m the
Craziest
Person
You'd ever met,
And I liked that
And you
Did too.
And I was scared,
It would
Scare you,
But you love
That
I’m crazy
And I hope
That
You are
Too.
On da bus
I’m
On da bus
And it
Feels so good,
The little
Vibrations,
They got the lights
Turned out,
And the sun hasn’t
Come up yet
And
I got me
Earphones in
And
I’m listening
To

Woody Guthrie
I feel like
A cowboy
And I wish,
I was on my way
To you.
Serena
Could you tell,
I was drunk
And
I been drunk
And I ain’t
Been eating
Much
At all,
And I been
Losing my mind
But I felt
Good
When you were
There,
It made me feel
So much better.
And did you know,
​
You got a little
Baby mustache
​
On your face?
I think
You know
And you leave it there
On purpose
And I like
That about you.
Girl on da bus
There’s a girl
On the bus,
If I
If we

Had to all have
Sex, it’s obvious
We would have
Sex,
But we don’t have to,
And I don’t want
To
And she looks young,
She gave me
A look
As I walked down
The bus aisle,
And that’s
When I knew,
If
We had to
We would.
AdelineReadsSHANNON
You read my
Poem
About when
I was drunk,m
And I talked about
Fucking
This girl,
But I hope you
Know,
That I didn’t,
And
That I don’t
Want to
And I just want
You,
And luckily I mentioned
That part in
The poem
also.
BAD BOYZ
It’s dark
And gray

outside and
I hope it stays
Like this
All day,
It makes me
Feel
So good.
The sky feels
Like a
BAD BOY
Right now,
And I feel
Like one
Too.
And maybe we'll conspire
To murder
The sun,
But I do like the
Sun on
Sometimes,
But not when
I feel like
A
BAD BOY.
Inspired
I been
So inspired since
You came
Around.
And I think
It’s cuz
Your beautiful
And fascinating,
But also,
I think it’s
Cuz you
Think my
Brain is special

And
IMPORTANT,
And I think
I needed that,
She thought
My brain was
Good too,
But I think
I value your
Opinion
More,
And now I
Just wanna keep
Proving it
To you.
How long
HOW
LONG
Can I keep
Going,
How many
Pages
Can I make,
It’s a game I play and
The higher the
Number,
The better you are,m
But I’m too
HUNGRY
TOO
TIRED
To keep going,
But I am still going,
Ah,
Maybe I’ll nap now.
GENYUS

You said I’m a
Genius,
I wonder if
You think
I’m a genius
Cuz you
Like me
Or, if
You like me
Cuz
I’m a
Genius,
Either way is fine,
I guess both,
Are possible
I like u
And u r a
Genius too.

My hat
Says

One of my
Sweaters
For it
In Houston;
I wonder if I
Should take
It off around
Charlie’s mom;
Cuz maybe
She
HATES ACID,
I’m not even

Sure if I <3
Acid,
I just find it
Interesting,
And
That’s enough
Of a reason
For me
To like something.
Walking Around
New york,
It’s disgusting
Here,
We are all
On our
Way somewhere
To
Trade
Reproduce
Learn,
And we all want
So much
And
They don’t
Hide
That here
And it’s disgusting
And I
Love it.
Bad Band

Saw
Charlies BAND
LAST NITE
And
Charlie is so good
And
Complex,
But they,
Are so bad and

Simple.
They are good
At their
Instruments
In the
Worst
Possible
Way,
The singer kept
Flicking his
Hair
The drummer and
Guitarist
Took their shirts
Off,
I couldn’t stand for
It as it
Was
Gross,
But I couldn’t
Stop looking
At the
Guitarists
Bouncing
Chesticles.
The singer kept
Asking the
Crowd
How
ARE YOU
GUYZ
Doing tonite?!
No response
Was ever
Enough
For him,
Some thing
Must have been
Wrong
With his
Ears,

Cuz he couldn’t hear them
Respond.
The cherry
On top
Was when
He demanded
Everyone put their
Phone flashlights
In the sky;
Despicable
As it was,
I wondered
What if looked
Like
For him.
Rebel that I am,
At the
End of the show
Everyone
Applauded
A lot,
Foolishly,
But I ,
Gave a few,
Only
1 or 2
Contained
And subdued
Snaps,
Out of love
For my
Boy,
Charlie.
Lex
A weird
Thing happened,
At the show
Last nite
In NEW YORK
I saw
Lex,

A boston
Musician,
Slight,
Evil genius.
While I don’t care
For her
Music,
You can
Just tell
With some people
Like that,
They are a little
Crazy
Sick in the head
So we
Hung out,
She smelled a
Bit,
Reeked of cigarettes,
Reeking,
Of something
Is sometimes
Another sign
Of genius
Strangely.
We had a
Great talk,
And we
Complained
About
All the
Unoriginal
Boring,
Disgusting
People of
The scene,
It was great,
I respect
Her,
But hanging out
With

A person
Like that
Makes you
Wonder if
They
Respect
You.
Rebel
You are
So old,
You stumble
Around
And you pee where
You want
Like a
Baby
And the way you eat
So ravenous
Disgusting even
And I like it
And I
Pity you
And I wonder
If you just wish
You could
Die
When you lie
In that
Cage
Of theirs.
Funeral
There’s some real
New Yorkers
Italians in here
She said
Connie said
It took a while to find a
Parking spot
The first lot was full
The second
Too

So we just parked on the street
I came in and I
Sit on the couch while they
Are in there saying hi
No one seems to be
Crying
I heard this guy was
Real old
So no one seems to be
Too sad
A lot of these people haven’t seen
Eachother in
A while
The hugs
Are intentional.
I sit outside the wake room
It sounds loud
I wonder
If his dead body is here
I wonder
If charlies looking at him
Right now
His old great uncle
And it would be
Interesting
To see a dead body and
Not feel
Much.
But I remember,
One time I saw a
Dead body
On the train tracks
And I didn’t know the guy
And I didn’t feel
Much,.
But still
I couldn’t
Help
But feel something
And think about what
It would be like ;,
Fucked up

Laying on those tracks
Feeling the vibrations
As it got closer
Louder
Until it sliced you
And the slice would last
A while I’m
Sure.
And then
You die
alone,
And the cops come
And point
Flashlights at you
And a boy
On his bike
Looks out onto the train
And sees a glimpse
Of ur dead body
And I bet
You never thought
I would ever
Think of you
But here I am
Watching you
Again.
The pastor
I can tell he started,
The talking people
Shut up,
And there’s a certain
Cadence
To the way he
Speaks and
It’s so specific
And I wonder
If it could inspire me
If one pastor
Just ever talked
Without trying
So
Hard

To sound
Important
To sound
Nice
To sound
Convincing
Maybe then
If someone could just talk
In front of others
Like a normal
Person
We could finally
Believe in
Someone
Something.
And maybe
We would be
So
Doomed.

Yeah (the game
It’s a foolish thing
To text back
When all they give you is
Is
“Yeah”
But I do
Because I’m a fool for you
And I can’t help
But keep
Being one.
But you did respond to
My question after
Your
“Yeah”
But I won’t respond
Because
You didn’t ask me one back

And this is the game.
I’m doomed
I keep
Playing
And I should probably
Just
Quit.
I wonder
If your playing it too
And we are both
Agonizing.
Playing it.
But this game
Has a way
Of isolating
You.
I always feel like
I’m the one
Being played
And I still do
Feel that way.
I pray
your not
Winning
And we both just
Think the other are
And I hope
We want
The same thing.
D Room
There’s a room
In this funeral home
As I sit on the couch
Waiting for charlie
And his family

And this room
It has this big D
Hanging over it
I don’t know what it
Means
And I seen a couple people
Walk in
Walk out
I thought about if the bathroom is in there
And what if
I went in
Only to realize
That’s where they keep
His body
And I won’t do it
I don’t think.
But I kind of
Want to see it
I want to see
His dead body.
I’d like to see the
Dead body
Of a man
Old man
Who seems he had
A good
Fine life.
And I wonder if
His eyes
I wonder
How they look
If he was content
If I could find out
Who he was
Just by looking at
His face
It’s a rare
Almost impossible
Thing

To look at someone’s
Face,
When they are doing nothing to
Control it.
Completely
Relaxed
And I’m sure his face
Is relaxed
And it’s so rare
To find someone
Who isn’t trying
So hard
to make their face
A certain way
And I feel myself
Doing it all the time
But
When I look at you
When we have no questions
Nothing left to say
I find we let go
Of our faces,
We don’t hide
Behind giggles
And it’s
Intense
And I
Like it.
So instead
Of sneaking into
That old dead man’s
Room
I think I’ll just wait
Till next time
I see your face
And you’ll remind me
Of a dead guy
And I’ll remind me
Of a dead guy
In the best way
Possible.

Small book
I think
I’d like to get
A small little book
So I can write
At all times
And I never felt like I could
Before
But I just unlocked the power
And I like typing these into
My phone
But it would be more
Cooler
Sophisticated
Interesting
If I could just bring g around
A little book
To collect all
My evil and
Plain thoughts.
Reading
I aint
Felt like
Reading lately,
I don’t
Feel like it
Now,
I found it
Easy to read
About peoples
Stories when
My life was
Boring.
But now that
Things are picking
Up,
I’d rather
Write mine
Than

Read theirs.

6 pack
I wonder
How
Bukowski felt
Huddled over that
Typewriter,
Vonnegut,
Chainsmoking
All day
Other people….
They’re
The only
Ones
I really care
About.
I bet there bodies
Sucked,
I’m gon
BE THE FIRST
EVR
POET WITH
A SIX-PACK
AND ALL
​ THE GIRLS WILL
SWOON
AS I
READ MY POEMS
AND THEY
LICK MY CHEST.
Lost n Found

I lost my
Fingerboard when I
Was out last
Night,
Getting
Drunk with
Charlie.
I called a couple
Bars to see if
I left it.
I decided to accept
It’s gone
Forever,
And it’s okay,
But then,
An hour before
I had to leave,
The uber driver
Called me
And I got it back,//
And I couldnt believe it,
And I realized,
What a great feeling it
is , to
Accept that something is
Gone, only to be
Proven wrong.
12 am bus from new york to boston
I can’t see
What I’m writing,
It's so dark,
This bus is filled to
The top
With all the worst kinds
Of people,
Vampires and smellies,
Including myself.

But the person next
To me is the
Worst of
Them all,
Because
They are so clearly
Over their half
Of our row.
Their head is spilling all over
My shoulder
Their body is practically
Consuming me.
I wish there was
A laser that
Would slice their
Body parts
Off, for every
Infraction
they commit.
Being Prolific
I’ve already
Written so much
Since I got this
Here journal
And it makes me
Feel so good
About myself,
I hope
I can keep it
Going.
I feel like these little
Poems,
I discovered a
Way of journaling,
A perfect way,
To adjust for
My hatred of writing
A lot,

Instead I can just
Use what’s necessary
And use spacing
For dramatic
Effect.

Idiot
I think
You
Find the way I
approach things and
Live my life,
You find it
So stupid
But it’s okay
Cuz I’d
Rather be
An idiot
Than be
Just like
You.
Charlie
Charlie boy,
You deserve
The world you know,
You are
So pure,
So good,
You deserve to be
​
Worshiped
After how you been
​
Treated.
The beautiful
Thing about you is,
I’m not sure you
Would ever let
Anyone worship

You.
You like to get
Fucked
Don't you
Boy.
Untitled
What a foolish thing
To name a poem
Before you write
It, before you know
What it will be
What it could be
Its self sabotaging
Really,
And I do it
All the time,
But sometimes I just
Can't help but picture things,
Before they begin.

Nevr Say Nevr
Even if I write
1 million
Terrible
Poems,
Song,
Maybe there could
Be one
Good
One great
One,
So I
Try
To write a lot,
As fast,
As I can
So the odds are
Greater,.
But I get the feeling,

Even if you
Guys think
One of them is
Good,
Great,
I will never
Ever
Believe you.
Bitch Boy 4
Im sitting here
Drunk
At my desk
Listening to Radiohead
Like a
Certified
Hipster bitch
Boy,
I don’t usually listen
To em,
I swear
But I’m trying em
Out,
And I do like
It,
It feels so good
To just sit
Here and
Look at the wall
Without 1000
Things
Fucking me
At once.
Silence
I turned off the
Music,
Cuz I figure
It’s much
More interesting/
Charismatic
Of me
To just sit at
My desk,

Drunk,
Staring at the
Wall,
With nothing to
Entertain me
Except my thoughts,
But
I had to
Pick up my notebook
To write this down,
Now,.,
I will return to my
Epic,
Profound,
Silence.
Jazz Class
I keep thinking
About fucking
You and I’m
Excited to.,
I’m in my
Jazz history class
Right now
And I
Just realized
Ashleigh is in this class,
Can’t wait
Till we have sex so
I can look over
And think to myself
I’m fucking ur girl.
Gum in Class
I been chewing this gum
For so long,
But I won’t spit it
Out because I’m
Too lazy to get
Up in front of the
Class to do that,
So I just let

It sit in my
Mouth and try my
Best to
Ignore it.,
TO B CONTINUED ,. MORE TRANSPOSING TO COME BATCHELOR BREAK.,,./.
Magnum Dong
I’m thinking,
I should probably
Grab some of my
Roommates condoms
When I come over
Tonite,
But they r magnums,
I have a kinda
Big penis
But I thought those
Were for huge penises,
Before I ever bought
​
Condoms
I always thought they
Would be labelled
At the store:
Small
Medium
Large
But they are not and I’ve
Always
Been so disappointed
About that.
Analog
There’s a girl
In my class
Programming notes
On her computer
In the middle
Of class
Right now,
How can you do
That?

What is wrong with
You
I find it rude,
She’s wearing an
Airpod,
I could
Never,
To be fair, I am
Writing in the middle
Of class right
Now,
But at least my
Way
Is analog
U dumb
Bitch.
Riley
A girl once said
She confuses
Us all the time.
I didn’t like that,
Ur a nice guy,
But I don’t rly
Like ur style
It is similar to mine,
But I feel the
Small differences
Are noteworthy.
That’s all, I just thought
It would be juicy to write
A poem bout the guy
Next to me.

Maevasdjlhfblaksdjfhbalsdkjfb
ha,
Someone said u
Got a really
Wet pussy,
I wanna fuck
You,
I can’t
Even te4ll what you
Look like wit those huge
Fucking glasses you wear,
But for some reason
I wanna fuck you,
I bet you’d like to
Fuck me,
Huh.
Rizz
I forget if
I already
Wrote a poem about
This but in
NEW YORK
Charlie told me
One night I got
The craziest
Rizz,.
I don’t like that
Word
But I like what
He said,
Plot twist what
If I am actually
Hot and smooth
And I can get
Any girl I want,
I really never
Expected this turn of
Fate,
Maybe I will be
King
Afterall.

Running into a Girl at School
I hope I run into
You in the hallway
I hope you walk by
Here and see
Me ravenously
Writing
And it
Turns you on,
no,
I am not writing because
Of you
Or as a show,
But you did help me
Realize there
Is a point
To writing,
And I’ve really grown
To like it,
But besides all
That,
I’d still like it
If you walked by
And saw me,
I think you’d
Find it
Hot, me sitting here
Writing a
Bunch.
Some of it even,
About you.
A New Format
I’m glad
I discovered
Writing poems,;
This format of
Writing, cuz
When I tried
journaling/
Writing a book,

I couldn’t quite do
It,
But this just feels
So natural
And it feels
Good too,
I still hope to
Write a
Book one day,
This reminds me of
When I was
13,
Making beats,
Dreaming of making an
Album
One day,
And boy did I
Make some.
Note2Self
I did a bold
Move and I
Put my arm around
You and you got
Right in and found
Your place
Oh,
I touched ur hair,
I smelled it,
I touched you,
Man,,
I love you
I am crazy
Les not get drunk
Tonite ok?
I’m talking to you Scotty,
If Adeline wants to,
Okay,
But,
Not alone again
I should learn
How to be happy

Without it,
I really love writing,
This is no poem
Son,
This is for me,
I really wonder if
Someone would
Like reading it

Musical Reflection BabyTime
The songs I been making
Lately,
They feel so good
When I play em
I really think they r
Great songs,
But I cant find
The right way
To capture them
I was trying to get
Back into the computer
And it was fun
At times,
But I don’t know
My songs weren’t as good
As your songs,
I don’t think
And that gets to me,
I feel such a desire
To be the best
At something
#1
Better,
More creative,
More inventive,
Than all the rest,
And I think you can hear
That in the music

And that is
Not a good thing.

SlitheryLittleSnakeGirl
Whenever I look
At our texts
I always cringe
At the things I say
Always
Feel like I’m
Playing it wrong,
I should probably
Be cooler
More elusive,
But remember that one time
I left in the middle
Of our conversation
And it just made
You sad,
But I think you are
Being elusive,
And I hate to
Be the one
Chasing after you.
I went into the bathroom cause i’m drunk
i keep thinking about
what it would be like
to have sex
with you
I keep thinking about sex
and its all
i’ve thought about
for months
I think it would
freak me out
a little
but I get more curious
the more I think about it
I only had sex with a guy

once
I was 18
and he was
a reallybadguy
when I think about having
sex with u
I imagine
a
black hole
where my body should be
don’t take it personal
that I want to have sex
with aaron too
it doesn’t
make me want to
have sex with you
any less
it’s just that
I’ve always been
in love with him
I thought about having
sex with you
before we even talked
I watched you in class
and I imagined
what
it would
feel like to have my arms around
your shoulders
cause they lookedgood
I think it was when u wore
all black
that one time.
u looked good in
that shirt
and
I reallylike
when u wear
ur glasses
serena likes it too
god
i’ve been so horny
for months

Goth Day
Hah,
You wrote a poem
Bout wanting to
Fuck me
And the highlight
Was when I was
Wearing all
Black and
Wearing that shirt
That dumb one
“Heart of a Wolf
Soul of a Dragon”,
I really never expected
That thing to
Get me laid, but
Maybe you got
Taste
Afterall.
Goth Day Rebuttal 5/8/24
For the record,
It was NOT
The heart of a wolf
Soul of a dragon
Shirt,
It was the
LOUDER​
​
IS
​
​
BETTER
Shirt,
And you didnt think it was that,
You even
Wore ur Other
Black shirt to class
One day
Hoping it was the
One.
But i knew it wasn’t
Even though
I couldnt picture the right one.
At ur place,

It was after
The first time we showered
At ur place,
You asked if i wanted
To borrow some
Clothes
And i said
Pick some out for me
And when i came back
From the bathroom
There it was!
Layed out on the bed
For me to wear.
The
LOUDER​
​
IS
​
​
BETTER
Shirt,
And i laughed cause
I immediately remembered
And it was another one of
Those
Funny cringe fate moments
And i was happy to wear it
And i was happy to see
You wear it again.

SexPOEMABOUTURPUSSSYSYYY
I really am
Intrigued by
Your pussy
I wann fuck you
Hard I want
To make your eyes
Roll back
I want to dominate you,
Make you mine,
I want you to look into
My eyes
As I fuck you,
With that look that we
Share,
It could be crazy,

I really hope it goes well,
I want you to beg
Me to fuck you
Harder,
I wonder if you like being
Choked you
Fuckin whore,
Hah,
I never use the phrase
Fucking whore in real life,
But I really find it
Fun writing it,. .,,.,.
Aight been in this room
A while I gon
Go eat and go home
Now, bye.
Cane’s
Something about
Sitting alone
Ravenously eating
Chicken and fries
And slurping sprite
Disgusts me,
Something about this
Place is so
Depressing too,.
The radio,
The discoballs,
The lady yelling
FRESH HOT CHICKEN
FOR SCOTTY,
Being here really
Makes me feel
Weird and a bit
Depressed,
But still,
I come here every
Tuesday
Cuz the chicken
And the sauce is
Just
So good.

Emma
I love you
So much,
I miss you
So much,
My life just started to get
Eerily comfortable and
Boring at times and
I fell in love
With a girl in my class
Why?
I don’t know,
But I sure miss you,
I really hope to get
You back one day,,.,.,
That day 2 weeks ago
We fucked
And talked and it
Made me feel so
Much better,
But it’s worn away
Now,
And things with
Adeline may
Not be panning out,
I started with 2
And ended
With
Zero. f.
SadBoiDay
I just don’t
Feel good,
Nothing feels good,
I don’t know how
To feel happy today
I feel so
Depressed,
Nothing interests me,
I laid in my
Bed all day,
I couldn’t nap;
I wasn’t tired

But I just laid
There, waiting for the
Day to pass me by,
Eventually I rolled over
And watched videos
On my phone and
It just made it all
Worse:
To succumb myself
To that vulgar world,
you tube should
Die,
I should die,
I don’t mean it,
I’m just so
Unhappy and
bored.
Slave
I keep
Checking my phone
To see if you’ve texted,
Already
My happiness is
Becoming a slave to you,
But I just know
If you asked me
To comover tonight,
Everything
Everything
Would feel better.
Punk
I think I have begun
To become a punk,
I never made punk
Music,
Never listened to it,
Yet I find myself at
The point where
I care so little
About anything,
And that might be what
Being a punk is.

But I also care so much,
So much,
Too much
And I can't bear
To do certain things
To be a certain things
Punk is rejection
Punk is depression
Of everything around me
Punk is watching
Punk is hating you
Punk is hating everything
I care so much
About not caring
The way you do,.
Does that mean im a
Punk?
Corndogs
I been living off
Frozen corn dogs lately,
1 for breakfast
2 for dinner
It’s so easy,
So cheap,
10 minutes in the microwave
Is all I need
To say
Alive.
Shower
I took a shower
A couple hours ago,
I so desperately
Want to feel something,
I may just
Take another one
Sit there
For a while
Water is free in
My building,
After then after,
Hopefully I’ll be

Tired enough
To fall asleep
And this day
Can be over.
App Idea
I wish there was
An
App, that would scan
My whole naked
Body and sent it
Out there to all the
Girls and it
Would locate
The ones that
Want to come over right
Now
Drink
Fuck
Then leave before
My roommate
Gets back
From karate.

SCOTTY”S SAGA OF SHARING A EVIL POEM IN CLASS
Pt 1,.
Show n Tell
I find it hard to comment on your work
I have nothing but bad to say to you
We share and then we jack each other off
I raise my hand I pity those who fail
The praise is false don’t trust the things I say
Don't snap, just drop my pants and suck me off.

Pt 1,. I FELT BAD AN SO THEN I DECIDED<DD I HAD TO MAEK A N
APOLOGY POEM FOR THE CLASS AND MY TEACHER GAVE ME A
THUMBS UP
Sry

I say the things I do, I don’t know why
It’s all a ploy for your atten-ci-on
I wonder if it works, I think it does
I don’t know if I like the way I am
I don’t know if I could stop if I tried
I’m still deciding who I want to be
Forgive me for this awkward time between.

Lost Pen
I was
Walking
To sit
Right here,
When I got to
My planned
Chair I opened
My notebook
And I
Realized
My pen ran
Away,
So I
Went back
The way I
Came,
And sure enough
There it was
On the
Floor
Waiting
For me.
Oh, to drop something
And come back to it
Waiting so faithfully,
What a
Bitch.

Bruh
I thought
Maybe I didn’t
Have any poems
In me today,
But I
Sat down,
To give it a try,
And sure
Enough there
They were
And I
Realized
So long as I’m alive
I’ll have something
To say
If I can just
Learn to
Listen.
Untitled 2
Sometimes I can’t
Come up with
A title
Goodenough
To make the
Poem interesting,
A title that
Won't spoil
Nothing,
Sometimes I
Just Wish
The poem alone
Would be enough
And I didn’t have
To label it
For you to
Care.
Sick
I hope I’m
Not getting sick
My body feels

A little weird,
Though,
Infairness,
I did
Stay up all nite,
Smoke some cigarettes,
Drink a bunch of coffe,
Take adderall,
And all I ate today was
1 corndog
So I’m prolly fine,
I was actually
Thinking bout
Picking up some more
Boxed wine
On the way home
To drink
Tonite,
To feel good,
Get emo,
And write
Some poems,
There’s not much else
I feel like doing.
Time
You said you
Never think
About the time.,
That
Your always late,
And
That could
never be
Me,
I am always
Trying
To maximize
My time,
Spend it well,
With my friends
Or
Making things,
I do sit

At home a lot
And do nothing
Sometimes,
But I feel so
Horrible about
Myself when I
Do that.
So when I have a time
To be somewhere
I get there
Cuz if I’m not
Having fun somewhere
Else,
Or making something important,
What am I doing with my life.
Arrival
You know
I’m punctual
And I know
I’m punctual
And you told
Me to head over
At 5 but
I figure I’ll
Head out round
5:02, 5:03,
And maybe I’ll
Stop to feed myself
At 7/11
On the way
In the form
Of
Taquitos
For a more
Stylish
Arrival.
Just so you know
There’s much more
Going on in my
Life besides you,
Like these
Taquitos
For instance.

Passing By
I keep
Thinking
About seeing
Him at
School,.,
If certain
People are
Him
Or not.,,.
And if I passed
Him:
Whether or not,
Or how much
Hatred to
Hold
In my eyes.

Being a Writer
Lately I been
Thinkin
Bout trying to be
A writer,
Seein as
It feels real good
To do it.
I want to do it
For the right reasons
I read a Buk
Poem
One time
It said,
“This guy
He didn’t
Want to be a writer,
He wanted to succeed
As a writer”
I want to

Make sure my
Desires are not based
On success
It feels good to get
It out
What’s inside of me,.
If I only ever
Showed Adeline
My poems
And she read em
I could be
Satisfied.
What scares me
About being
A writer
Is how
Depressing
It seems,
It seems
Like you
Gotta kill yourself
To be
A writer or
At least
Get close;
But Adeline
Says not to
Worry
About
All that
And just keep
Writing and
I think
That’s what
I’ll do.
Phonecall from u
You called me and
You said
That it freaked
You out
Us hanging out
So much the

Past couple days,
That you were
Obsessed with me,
That you
Could
See yourself
Spending all your time with
Me
And that scared you
Cuz you were excited
To be single
And spend time alone.
I was glad you told me,
I was a lil sad
Cuz it felt so good
To be with you,
But I figure,
You prolly just need
Some time
To be
Alone
And get
Depressed
Like I did
And then you’ll
Realize,
This is much better.

Showz ovr 4 now,. Ltr
Its my turn now here’s all the poems i wrote LAST NITE

Nosebleed In The Mastering Lab
I wanted to cry but my nose started bleeding
and the blood
wont stop coming out
it’s really making
a big mess
I’ve been wanting to cry

for a while
but my body hasn’t let me yet
maybe it was some
sick bargain for a different type of release
I couldn’t cry
so it had to come out
somehow
I told you I was feeling good about it
even though u were feeling
really bad
but i’m actually feeling really bad
and this is my second nosebleed
since monday night
Writing powers
I like the way you write
so furiously
cause I do it too
I think about us both
Scrunched up
Scrawling
Over our journals
Gripping the pen
and I wonder if
we combined every penstroke we’ve ever done
And straightened it into
a
​ long
thin
line
how far it would stretch
Good vs. Evil
I know youre a good guy
I can just see it in your face
even through i thought
you might be evil for real
based on your songs
and poems
even now when I

read them
I have to remind myself what
you’re really like
The way you write about
certain stuff is so
gross
in a way that is just
on the
edge
of being a little too real
youre evil in writing
but sweet in practice
I think im sweet in my
writing
but evil in practice

Reflecting on Nosebleed in the Mastering Lab
I got real sad
and just felt so bad
and serena told me what was what
which usually cures me
but this time
it just made everythingworse
I walked out and
called u to say
Im freaking out
and you always say the right thing
unlike him
which is why I was upset
in the first place.
im sorry i dragged u into
this mess.
I started bleeding so hard
It wasnt outside the realm of possibility
That i might bleed out.
I had to look at myself
for a long time in that

bathroom mirror.
Im breaking out
I spat out a huge blood clot
So big that it couldnt go down the
drain
I dont look very good today
but at least it wasnt like I
tried hard to or anything.

Sad but can’t cry
​
​
I wish I could cry so bad
I cant even remember the
Last time it happened.
All i had been thinking about
was sex
but now the only thing im
craving
is just to sob.
Its almost like being horny
Imagining that specific feeling
over and over
how my body would feel
im going into a real dark place now
I can feel it
I was high for a while
The only time ive ever really
felt manic
but im going away now
and serenas coming down too
so theres really
no choice
cause I feel what she feels
​
​
​
that witch
It’s Potion Time
I walked back and
had to think about

my breathing
​
I wrote stuff down in
my notes app
and felt worse
I liked when you told me
to write the poem
about the nosebleed
cause I was already thinking
of doing it
so I did and it felt good
doesnt it feel so crazy
that we met
it’s really changed a lot of
things
when you say things I know
exactly what you mean
It feels significant
that we met and both started
feeling
Inspired
​
I feel like u unlocked
a secret power that I had
that was dormant before.
Anyway
I felt so horrible getting home
​
so I took most of the
potion (I didnt mean to take that much)
​

​

It tasted like whiskey and it dissolved my pain

Freaking Out pt. 77
I feel so confused
cause i like when
we kiss
I think
but I like it better
when we just talk
I liked falling asleep on ur chest
but there
are so many poems
about us having sex
that exist now
And​ its not like

I think you expect something from me
​
Its just that
I usually always know
what I want
Notes App Poem Walking Home From Nosebleed in the Mastering Lab
everything is disgusting me
everything is freaking me out
I think I smell like blood
and I don’t want her to know
what that song
was about
I got what I want
but it’s wearing me down
now I have to pretend
I don’t want u around
Monday Nite
I kissed her
Last nite
For the first
Time,
And I wanted so
Badly for it to be
Good, and my thoughts
Ran all over me,
I couldn’t decide how
Long we should
Kiss, what I
Should touch,
How to lay,
And I don’t think I ever have
The answers right away
And that’s okay
And the more
We laid

And kissed
Everyonce in a while
It started to
Get better
And
Better
And I could even feel
My penis
Rise,
And I wondered
If she could
Feel it,
Or see it when
I got up to leave
At 3 am
Because I
Couldn’t sleep
And I wanted to wake
Up at my house
So I could
Take adderall
And practice guitar
And write songs,
But I sure did
Miss her
As I laid there
In my bed,
And I think I would’ve
Rathered
Lay there all nite
Awake than
Go home without her
again.

Death to Aaron 2
She fucked
Aaron,
And I don’t like
It
One bit,
But I’m a bit
Surprised:

I don’t feel destroyed
I don't think I’ve lost her
Yet,
I didn’t
Get too sad about
It,
Instead,
I just wrote a song
About
Killing him
And it was
Rly
fun.

This guy
Nice guy,
Guitar nerd,
Said one day during
class that during
Spring break
He spend 10 hours and
8 minutes
Practicing,. In one day,
He said he times himself,…
Depressing as hell,
You still don’t
Know
How to feel something
On that guitar of urs.

Arthur
I’m sry,
That i stole
Your style
So obviously
I’m sorry I couldn’t
Be as
Unique as

Good as
You.,
I just thought you
Were so good
And I wanted to
Be you so bad
And I’m
Still finding,
And I’m
Still learning to
Like myself,
But I hope
You can
Understand,
Copying is
The purest
Form of flattery,
At least that's
What my
Teachers always
Use to say,
Who knows
If they even
Know
Anything.

Dual of Awesome and Smelly
She didn’t
Want to have
Sex last nite
And
Neither did I
For some reason,
She
And me,
Genuinely
Just feel like taking
It slow,
I don’t know
Why,

But that feels right,.
But,
Now that she fucked
Aaron,
It makes me think
Maybe I
Should fuck
Her
Soon
And
Harder
Than
Aaron.
CollegeMonsterMashMan (thankunext2)
I’ve realized
I pick up
Coolness from all
Those around
Me who
I rly love
I take little parts
Of the4m
And I hold onto
It for
Myself,
And I wonder
If I’ve just become
A culmination
Of everything
Everyone
I ever loved,
And if I
Have,.
So be it,
If I was just
Part of
Everyone I ever loved
Or thought
Was good.
At least then,
I could believe in/

I could love/
Myself.
Serena4
I think
We both
Decided
She is god
And we will
Abide by her will
She says she’s rooting
For me
At least
GOD
Is on my
Side.
TV
You don’t
Watch TV
You don't
Even
Have a tv
And I find that
So good.,
Tonite me and my
Roommate
Watched the bachelor
As we do
Every week
And I couldn’t
Make myself
Care,
And I find
Myself
Becoming more
Like you
And I like
That.

Tall Tales ., Legends of the Pee Boy

I always sit
When I pee,
At least 90
Percent
Of the time,
I don’t know why,
So many
Guys
Hold so much
Pride
In their ability to
Stand,
I honestly think it’s
Out of laziness,
But,
When I was at your
House,
I peed
In your bathroom
And I peed standing
To be a man,
But I made
Sure
To aim for
The side,
Not the water,..
To avoid water
And pee
Reflecting at me,
And
To be stealthy
Cuz I knew
You were out there
Listening to
Me.
Spiky Ring
I member
The other nite
I purposely
Didn’t wear that

Ring I
Sometimes wear on
My middle finger,
Just in case,
I finger you;
I washed my hands
Extra good too
For you,
In case,
You care about
That kind of
thing.
Emma
Ever since
I left you,
I find myself
Going crazy
And I love
It so much
And i miss u
So much.,but
I just couldn’t
Bear to be
So comfortable
And watch life
Pass me by.
F
Man,
It’s so easy
To be me
And I hate
That,
And I make it
So hard
For no reason,
And I wonder
How someonelse
Would do
Feel
Being
Me.

Dreaming
Last nite
I wrote
So many poems
When I
was dreaming
They’re all
Lost now,
It’s a shame
I wish
I could’ve
​
Held on
​
To all those
​
​
Thoughts
Written em
Down,
I don’t know why it
Feels like
Everythought
I have
Must be
Documented
Recorded,.
It wasn’t always
This way,
But it is now
And I like it.
RamblingLittleScottyBoy
When were apart

It always
Feels like
I have something
To say to you
Or, I wish I
Would’ve
Said something
Different,
I formulate
Master plans
As I sit in
The shower:
What to say to you,
How I should word
Text responses
To others.,
The shower feels
Like the best thing
In the world
For the first
10 minutes
After that I
Usually
Can't stay
Much longer
THE end.
Hamster Boy
I always
Try
To carry a paper
Towel in
One of my pockets
Cuz you never
Know,,
My sneezes
Are extremely
Explosive
And could
Seriously tarnish
My social
Standings.
Scrawling Away

You said that
Everytime
I write
It’s like
I’m scrawling
Away
Away,
And
It’s true,
I can't seem to
Do it slowly,
To do it
Without
Running,
Going
Crazy,
Falling into it,
It feels like having
Sex,
I go so hard
And the second
I finish I pull
Out
Click the pen
And get dressed
Almost immediately.
Pat
Heh,
I told you I changed
My poem
I switched it out
Cuz it was a
Bit edgy,
Over the line,
I thought you’d like
That kind of
Thing
But when I told
You I changed
It,
You said
You were
Glad.

Even though
It was ridiculous
Out of line,
If your a real one
It must’ve felt good
To hear
Something
Anything
That was a challenge
But I guess you all
Cant handle
That kind of
Thing.
Poetry Class
I don’t feel like
Being mean
Today in this
Class,
I felt mean last
Time,
I wrote a rly
Evil poem,
Basically saying everyone
In this class
sucks and
they should suck
My nuts,
But I felt bad
After,
So I wrote an apology
Poem,
And I’m usually so withdrawn,
I don’t clap
Only 1 or 2
Cool guy snaps,
But today I clap
Because I
Don't feel like
Being evil today.
Blood Poem
That poem u
Wrote bout

Feeling
Really bad,
Man I sure
Hope it
Wasn’t bout me,
This is one of those
Rare times I hope
You wrote something
About him
And not
About me.
Red Blue Factor
Yesterday
you r
Hands got all; red, all
Covered in blood
From your
Nosebleed,
You said you hadn’t
Cried,.
It had to come
Out somehow.
Today your hands
They got
All blue,
The pen bled all
Over you
Yesterday u red
Today u blue,
yesterday u like me
To day who knows
Ur hot
N
Ur cold
Girl,
Ur yes
And ur
No
U crazy
Girl

And i find it
So
Intoxicating.
Messy Lil White Boy
If you
Could
Take all that
Blue stuff
On ur
Hand,
From the bloody
Pen,
And put it on me,
I would love to
Have it on
Me,.
I love things like that
I love looking all
Messy and destroyed
I like it
When it looks
Like parts
Of me are falling
Apart.
I like stains
I treat my
Things
Badly,
I like how it
Looks,
I’m probably
A stupid person
For that,
But I like old
Destroyed things
Much more than the
untouched.
Girl in Class iDunno her name
Your not wearing
That huge
Coat of urs

Today,
To be honest
I forgot all about
You,
That you
Were even in
This class.
I guess that coat
Has a habit
Of eating u up
And u have a
Habit of
Letting it.
Pretty Orange Shirt
I’d say you
Look good
Today,
But I won’t
I figure I better
Start holding
My cards tighter,
I got a bad habit
Of giving
It all to you
And I just
Can’t help it,
But I’ll
Try.
Individuality Complex
Sometimes
When I’m in
Class and
I see someone
Sitting the same
Way as
Me., I have to
Make sure
To switch my
Position
Because it’s important
To me
To be unlike anyone

Else,

Scar
I see that
Scar
On ur wrist
That you always
Talk about.
I don’t like it:
That there will
Always be
A part of him
Imprinted on you.
I promise the scar
Is real,
I realize, reading this,
It might sound
Like im
Making up
The scar
As a metaphor,
But I promise
I’m not,
That would
Be cringe.
Studio A
I’m sitting in class,
I member one
Time when
I was in this room
Alone,
I rolled myself a
Spliff
And I felt
Like a real
Rebellious.
Baller.

I AM FWAY ROLEPLAY
Ah,
What to write
I don’t know
How could
I know how
To write
I’m not creative
I can’t do stuff
Like that.
Instead I suck up
Knowledge and skills
As my superpower.

The Devil
You said I’m
Evil in writing
Good in practice
And you’re
Good in writing
Evil in practice
I think
It’s true
But I hope you
Won’t be
Too evil to me,.
And I find myself
Worrying all the
Time
About what your
Thinking,
And I can’t
Wait
Till you start
Worrying
About me.

Am I Gay Quiz
in high school I would lie awake at night
wondering if i was gay or not
when there were no more
am I gay quizzes online to take.
I just remember wishing
some godlike being could just
tell me what I was
so I could just know for sure
and that would be the end of it.
it freaked me out that there was no one
I could ask,
no one in the world could tell me
for real
one way or another
no one that could just give me a straight answer
(or a gay answer)
and I have to figure it out for myself
I hated thinking about having a husband
cause that sounded horrible
and I hated thinking about having a wife
cause that would mean the world would see me
as a lesbian.
I got to college and realized it was ok
if the world saw me as a lesbian

so I dated 2 girls
it felt good
for a while
then I went home for winterbreak
back to the bed I layed in
in high school
and I had all these dreams about men
and I felt like I was 14 again,
awake at night, thinking
what
the
fuck
can
someone
just
tell
me
what
i
am
cause
i’m
so confused
and
it

feels
too
stupid
to
Google
“
Am
I
Gay
Quiz
”
again

Poem Face
I don’t know what to do with my face
after I finish reading a poem
I don’t like
when people smile
so smugly
after they finish it
as if they think
they are a Genius
and I dont think I could bare to smile like that;
wouldn’t want anyone to know that
I think i’m a Genius.

and
at poetry club tonight
some guy
(who I think is pretentious)
did absolutely
nothing
with his face
after reading his poem
he just stared blankly
which I somehow found to be
even worse

2WhiteBoyz
I hope this uber driver
doesn’t notice that
i’m checking myself out
in his rear view mirror
I wanted to make sure

within the past couple weeks
and I wanted to
make sure it was

I don’t know
Many
Poets,
Maybe 1 or
2;
Bukowski,

Well I was thinking: ,
If you keep writing
These poems maybe
You cld be
The first
Gay
Half white
Half filipino
Woman
To be come
Famous for epic
Poems
​
And I wonder
​
If you hate it
​
That whenever you
​
Do something; those

Labels, they follow
​
You around and I
​
Wonder if you just wish
​
Your name was all
​
They would think

Of.
Partners in Crime
There’s something
About when
Were together

It feels
Like we are
Either working
Together
To destroy the world
Or
To save it
And it always feels
Like the 2 of
Us are in on
something when
Were around
Others.
Maybe this is what
Happens when
2 fake evil
Or
Fake genius
Brains come together,
And I love
Thinking about
The 2 of us
Formulating master plans
Of our
Crusades
And how, if we did
Something, . anything
It could be
Important.
Life Hacks
It’s weird,
I took my
Adderall
Drank some
Coffee
But I still feel
A bit
Tired,
I wonder if my
Body is
Starting to pick
Up on this
Cheat i use
Where

I get drunk
And stay up
Late
And then do drugs
In the
Morning
To keep
Going.
Evolution
I use to
Always
Shame you
When we were
Together
And u were
On your phone
It’s just that
I hate when
People, when
I do it,
And I didn’t
Want me,
You,
To be like them
You said it was
Cuz I needed
Your attention,
It’s probably true,
But sometimes
I just wish

Was never
Invented.

Disgusting
Now,
How
Much 1 person,

When so many people
Have nothing,
I should be more

And less

Last week,
I didn’t drink the night
Before,
Didn’t wake up and
Take adderall
Or drink coffee,
No cigarettes,
I just went
About

My day like
A normal
Person
And it felt
So god,
So the next
Day I
Woke up,
Took adderall
And got
drunk.
Two of Us
Once
You start
To learn
How to write
Honestly,
Uninhibited,
It's so easy
To write a
Good poem,
You picked it up
In one night,
I can tell you
Already got it,
I guess anyone
Can do it
If they can just
Learn
To be honest,
But I don’t like
Thinking that,
I like
To imagine
Only the 2 of us
Can , because
We contain
A rare
Genius that is
Unmatched and

One day
they will finally
Understand us.

I’ve
Begun
To hate

The idea
Of THE
Manic pixie
Dream girl,
And I don’t
Think you
Dress,
Act,
Like one of those,.
You said,
You felt manic,
Truly manic
For the
First time
Recently,
And I believe you.
And I realized
For a bit
I thought
I had a thing
For those
Manic pixie
Girls,
But I think I just
Have a thing
For the truly
Insane,
And I wonder,
If I’m one of them
Too.,
True Evil
I often feel
like there is no choice
but to do
exactly what I want
and it doesn’t even matter

if it’s
right
or
wrong
because if I want it,
the decision
is already made
(and maybe that’s why i’m true evil)

Good to Know

.
Sailor
He lives for the sea
And he don’t
Know where
He goin
Or why
He even left,
But he mostly
Just thinks about
That when
He’s feeling depressed,
When he’s doing
Well,
When he’s at
His best,
He looks to
The water
In gratitude for
Letting him
Fly above fish.
The nights get
Nasty,
He turns to
A drunken sailor
And he yells
At all the
Fish till they
Bleed and
Bow down before
Him,
And he writes
Manifestos

Sacred doctrines of horrid truth
Late into the night,
He staples them to his
Chest,.
He’s left with no
Choice but
To wear them
Through the
Morning,
Surly ir would
Hurt to
Rip those
Out,
And he has before,
But he only does it
When necessary,.
He loves it when
People join
His crew,
He lays in
His quarters in
His hammock
As the others
Take care of all
Those big
Fat waves,
He can feel
The ship
Rocking back
And forth
And sometimes
When it gets real
Bad:
The storm;
He just accepts
It:
If he were
To die,
He was
Proud of
How he lead

His life,
And he
Sleeps
Peacefully.

Everyone always says
How easy
It is to have a
Baby,
Maybe I will just
Do that
And devote my
Life to
Something else
Because I drive
Myself crazy
Trying
To complete,
Locate,
My mission,
I really
Do miss

Being a baby,
A child,
Everything was so easy,
And I could
Be
So satisfied
With things
Being easy.
As I got
Older,
I started
To get
Sad
All the time
And people
Made it seem
Like if things weren’t hard,
You weren’t living
Right:,
It’s probably my
Greatest fear:
To live wrong,
That’s why
I’m gonna have
This baby:
To let go
Of it all
And give up
On life,.
My friend
Just had
A baby
And now
He’s a
Fireman,
They gave
Him a truck
And he
Lives at his
Girlfriends
Parents house,
Pays them

A lil rent,
Hangs out
With his child,
It feels
Like he gave
Up
On his life
And he’s just
Decided to try
At someone
Else’s.
It’s a nice
Idea,
But when
I really
Think about
It,
I find it so
Depressing:
His
Entire
Life:
School,
It was all in preparence,
Of something
And once
He finished
Preparing to
Do something
With his life
He decided
To just prepare
Someone else
instead./
I wonder if he is a
Genius
Or a
Dumb bitch,
Priest

I already wrote
A poem
Bout a priest
Once,
It was alright
Maybe this
One could be
Better,
It’s not
Looking
Too good though,
I got about 50 seconds
Left,
44,
And I ain’t got
Much to say
To you
Kid,
My best friend in
High school
His dad was a priest
And he
Was a
Really nice
Great
guy.
apr fool
I don’t like getting pranked
cause I feel
like an idiot after
but
that was pretty good
Villain does penance
yes I was a true villain last month
I did some bad stuff
really bad
and it all came out today
I had to confess all
to the people
I hurt most
I reached a new level
of self disgust

I feel like the devil
I can’t be touched
my brain is all metal
and it will rust
the dust will all settle
the crumbs and crust
Ur show
I really liked ur show
And both of ur outfits were good too
But
I couldn't see ur eyes at all
In those sunglasses
U think ur a cool guy huh
My aura
Serena asked me
​
How are u
And i said bad
And she said you're masking it well
And i asked her what my aura felt like
And she said
​
It feels like you swallowed a missile
​
​
​
​
​
​
(my body does deserve to get blown up from the
inside out)
I hope you like the book
I’m excited that you started it
And
That you said it reminds you of me
​
​
​
​
Sorry i havent gotten very far on ur book

You know that i was manic (i think i’ll stop soon)
ITrySoHardToBeNotMeSometimesAndit’sWorking
The more
I write
Poems,
I find the
Less I
Desire
To try
Hard to make them
Fucked up

I did it
Because I
Was so bored
Of all your
Boring poems
So I got evil
And
I stand by it,
But that don’t
Mean
I don’t
Feel bad for it
Sometimews
Say what
U want,
At least
It was
interesting .
U dumb
Thoughtless
oafs.
MasterofImprovTomfollery
I notice,
Sometimes
When you write
You sit and you
Think,
Sometimes I do
Too,
But I’ve found
The less
I think the
Better.
Genis Poem #1000
I told
You it’s
Okay to
Not be a genius
Everytime,

You said,
“Thanks”
But I think
It bothers you
When your
Not one,
But real genius
True geniuses,
While they
May not see it,
A piece of it
Is always
There,
So don’t feel
So bad
Hun.
Thank u Uber Driver
I like that
You didn’t
Wanna talk
Because I didn’t
Either.
And I like that
You had earphones
In so I didn’t
Have to feel bad
For ignoring,
Not acknowledging
Your existence
Except for a ,
“How ya doin”
Fingerboard
Fuck u
Sam
I’m not
Autistic
I just
Like
Playing with
Toys.

ButMaybeIAMTHEDEVIL
You rly been
Making me
Question
Myself.,
You told me
You found
My poems,
My songs,
Vile,
Disgusting,
You know I’m a good
Guy,
But sometimes
You have to remind
Yourself,.
I tell you it’s
All a
Front
An act,.
And I wonder
If it is
Or not,
All those
Despicable
Thoughts:
I had them
And I
Think everyone
Has them,
But I
Was just
Dumb enough
To write it all
Down.

Co-Star
I went on that
App to see
What kind of
Day they
Think I’ll have,
Sometimes it
Feels freakishly
Accurate,.
Let's see….
Trouble With:
. Routine
. Thinking & Creativity
. Spirituality
. Social Life
. Sex & Love
. Self
F.

Ded
I walked
Past that
Gutter
We used to hangout
In,
years ago
Back when we
First started
Dating and I
Couldn’t come
Into ur house
Cuz ur
Roommates
Hated men,
So we’d hangout
There in the cold,
It was right

Next to the
Sidewalk,
And sometimes
We’d scare people as
They passed
By,
It was all
So exciting and
Easy and
So obvious
I think those
Moments
Were the most sure,
Unquestioning,
Of my life,.
Everything’s
All confusing,
Foggy,
Now and
I’m never sure
what's Rright
Or
Wrong
I just try to
Survive now,
I was living
Then.
66 Towards Nubian
I was sitting
On the bus,
All the way
In the
Back,
I had enough room
To spread
My legs,.
I had a clear
View to
The front
Window

Of the bus,
The sun was
Setting,
Everything was turning
Orange,
The bus was vibrating
Chairs rattling,
I love it when
It does that.
I was so hungry,
I had to
Get home
To eat ravioli,
Luca was
Cooking,
But the closer
I got to
My stop,.
I got sad.
I could’ve stayed
On that
Bus forever,
It was just one
Of those
Moments where
I felt completely
Satisfied,
There so hard
To come
By,,
I just sat
And looked
Ahead
And I felt at
Peace,
And then I
Got off at
My stop.

​

Sex Tape
I’ve been
Masturbating
Way less
Recently,
I use to do
It
Everyday,
Now I do it
Like 1ce a week,
Maybe.
I can’t
Watch porn
These days.
All I can
Jack off
To is our sex tape,,
We did have
A pretty
Good sex life,
Sometimes I was
Just a
Horny monster,.
If you
Didn’t wanna
Have sex,
You would let me
Jack off and
Cum on
Your belly,
I did it
Pretty
Much
Every night.
How
Generous of you,,
I rly
Mean that.
Adeline said before

Her and
Her ex
Broke up,
They hadn’t
Had sex for months,
If
We hadn’t
Had sex for 3
Weeks
I would’ve probably broken
Up with you
Right then.
I’m seeing you today
At that old
Crepe place we
Use to go to,.
Hopefully
We’ll sneak back
To urs
And bang one out
For
Old times sake.
PANTS
I traded
Charlie
An old pair of
My pants
For a new pair of
His pants,
They fit great,
Perfect even,.
But I find
Them a
Bit, pristine,
I usually wear 1 pair
Of pants,
They’re

All destroyed
At the bottom
Falling apart,
And I just feel less
Like my
Self
When I wear
These new
Ones.
Meeting Up With Emma
That just
Made me
Feel sad.
That whole
Thing,
You didn’t
Want to have
Sex,
I did,
You said if
We did
I would have
To wear
A condom,
Because you
Had sex with someone
Else
Without out,
And that
Kills me.
FUKU
You said
You’ve
Been telling
Your
co -workers:
All of em
Virgins,

Aces,
About your escapades,
And fuk u
For telling
Me that,
Megan Fox
Was blowing
Up my phone
The whole
Time you
Were telling
Me ur story
At least
I could
Keep
My
Cool.
Day 1
Waking up,
Feeling so good,.
I made it thru
A night
Without drinking,
And I realized
When you don’t
Wake up
Hungover,
Feeling horrible,
Iz good.
Instead,
Now I wake
Up
And my
Body
And me
I
just
Feel so
Good.

If you can hold off
The buzz
At nite,
They give you one
For free
In the morning.
Laboratory
I love
That word,
I want one
One day,
My laboratory,
It seems
Like anything I did
In that room would
Be a genius.
Whore
Ah fuck you
For telling
Me fuck you
For
Fucking him
Your mine,
You ain’t allowed
To do nothin but
Sit and wait
Around for
Me.
Kiss Goodbye
I’ve grown to
Like kissing you,
I really
Have.
At first
I did feel it
Was a but
Funny,
But I don’t feel

That way anymore.
I always kiss you
When we
Depart,
Sometimes,
After,
I wonder if
We are
Kissing of
If
I am kissing
You,
I hope it’s the
First,
But I just like using
Departing
Kisses
As A
Declaration
Reformation
Of our feelings.
Lent
After this
Class
I will
Go to
The library
And hopefully
Get that book
You
Told me to
Read.
I got a lot of
My own
Books I’m excited
To read,
But I’ll drop em all
To read

Urs.
I lent her
A book,
She didn’t
Even start
Reading it,
I get the feeling
I won’t be
Ever
Getting it back.
I feel mad
At her,
I lent you
A book,
At least u
Read
20 pages.
HingeGirl
Matched with
This girl
On hinge,
She t3xted
Me.
I met her
Before,
She was seeing
One of
My friends
One time.
She seemed
Bitchy,;
Prolly gives
Good head,
I’d like
To fuck
A bitch,
Give her
What she deserves,
Lets see,

What she says.
AprilFoolsShow
Your coming
To my show
Tonite,
I hope
U r
Impressed,
I hope you
Still
Like
Watching me.
I hope you have
Fun,
Let's makeout
After
The show,
I love it when
You grab me
By my
Arm,
Shirt,
And drag
Me places
Like a
Child…:
Drag
Me to a
Dusty
Corner
And be
Obsessed
With me.

Leaving Class
I need
To blow
My nose
But sometimes
I feel too
Shy to
Get up
And walk out
In front
Of the class,
I wish I could
Hit a button
On my
Desk and
It would send me to
An under
Ground pod
Where I could
Blow my
Nose,
No one could
Hear,
See me,
Yeh dat wld be cool
Bye.
Ur Right
I felt
Cool
So cool,
I always do
When I
Play shows:
It’s the best,
I feel like
A rockstar
And I
Love it.
And you don’t?

Sunglasses didn’t help,.
But I had to
Wear em
For Charlie’s
Set,
It was a
Costume
Don’t get
Confused
Hun,
But wearing them
Did make
Me feel cool,
Real cool,
And like a
Real asshole,.
At this point
I’m not sure
Which I liked more.
Blackshirt
I think I
Figured out
Which
Black shirt
You were talking about
In that poem.
I put it on,
Thinking about
How we have
Class today
And maybe
You’ll se me
And your panties
Will just drop
And you’ll
Have no choice
But to
Embrace

Me.

Been writing
As many poems
The past couple
Days,
I cleaned up my
Act,
On sunday
I didn’t drink
At all,
On Monday (last nite)
I drank a bit,
But I was
Out playing

Acting Class
Right now,
I’m in my
Acting class,
Usually it’s
Pretty fun,
Today it’s
Fun,
But today I just
Find myself
Counting the minutes
Till I see
You.
I just feel
So alive
When we talk,
I don’t rly
Have much
Else to say
It’s never
That good
When I write
These kinds of
Poems,
But sometimes
I just
Have to.
Adeline 8000

Distracting
Me girl,
I should
Be writing
About the
Mysteries of
The

But instead
I’m just
Writing down
All 1000
Of my
Thoughts
About
You,
You like it
Don’t you.
My Iron Lung
I find it so discusting
How phones
Have become
Another appendage.
The other
Day I
Tapped my
Wallet,
Expecting it to
Light up,
Bring me some
Satisfaction,
And I hated
Myself
For doing that,
I try my best
To keep my phone
Out my
Pocket,
In my backpack,
Out of site,
Yet I still
Find myself
Needing
It all
The time.

Asking if you

Favors
Fway asked me
To help out
On his session
Tmrw night
6-12am,
I just don’t
Want to
Or feel like
It,

But unfortunately ,
We live
In a society
Where if
Someone asks
You
To do something
And you
Don’t want to
You can
Not say
That.
Instead, you must
Provide a
Reason,
So I guess I’ll
Just say
I can’t go
Cuz Luca
Has a karate belt
Promotion ceremony
Tmrw night,
Sry.

Everybody Poops
I walked all around
Berklee to
Find a
Secluded
1 person
Bathroom
To shit
In peace,
Eventually I

Found one,
Thank god
For all-gender
Bathrooms,
Yet even still,
Sitting in
There alone,
I felt
Nervous,
Rushed
By the sound
Of people
Trying the
Locked door,
I finished as
Fast as
I could
And fled
The scene
Of the crime.
Going CooCoo
I’m going
Thru
This journal
So fast
I’m having
More thoughts
Than I ever
Had before,
I think
I’ve begun to
Realize,
They were
Always there,
I just had to
Look for
them.
Poserz (isaiditb4)

I hate
Cryptic
Poems,
People hide behind
Combinations of
Words and
Metaphors,
They sit back
So content
Of their cleaver,
Subtle
Work,
Truth is
They got nothing
To say in
That head
Of theirs,
And they
Use these
Words,
Hoping
Some
Fool
Will fall for
It
And proclaim
Them
A genius
Least i’m straighforward
Bout being

I love
The sound
It makes,
Me flipping

If everyone in this

After
Poem,
And each time
I flip,
I start
Again
How impressive…
I can tell
They really
Are impressed,
My true fans
Are smart,
They make sure
To not watch
Me,
To stay covert,
But I know
They know.
We do what we do…
I started
Reading
That book you
Told me
About,
It really
Is very good,
And it does
Remind me
Of you,
It’s one of
Those books
That makes you
Want to be more
Like the narrator,
Less like
Yourself.
And I knew
You would like it
When I said
It reminded me of

You,
So I said it,
but , it
Was also
True.

Sorry 2 (unrelated)
Emma said it
Upset her
How easily I
Could give
Up on the ones
In my life that
Love me,
But I feel that
This is the
Time in my life
to be
Selfish.
Does that make me bad? Or a kid.

Nufin
I aint got
No songs
Today,
So many
Came before,
And I’m
Not happy
That I
Aint got
None today,
But I try to
Tell myself

I’m grateful
For the ones
I got before,
And I tell
Myself,
It’s okay to
Not write a
Songtoday.

It’s Okay
I don’t
Think
I feel like doing
Anything
Today,
I talked to Emma
And it
Was really
Good
And I feel much
Better about
It all
Now.
Emma always
Said it was
Okay to do
Nothing.
I have such a
Hard time
Agreeing with
Her philosophy of
Life,
I think she’s
Either
Enlightened of

Lazy,
I’m gonna try my best to
Be like her today.

Beginning of the End
Wow,
I’m already
Down
To the last
Section of
This notebook,
This is the most
Consistent
And
Best I’ve
Ever written,
It makes me
Feel so
Good to
Fill this
Notebook up,
I think for my
next notebook,
I’ll stay with the
Same style,
BIG NOTEBOOK WITH
LINES,
SPIRALLED SO I CAN
FLIP TO ONE
PAGE TO WRITE,
AND DEVIDED in
5 YELLOW THICK
SHEETS so I can
Feel like my life is a story
And passes by
In chapters.

Two Of Us 2
We talk
In prose,
We kiss
In rhymes,
When you lay on
My chest
It’s ambient
Music,
When were apart,
It’s all
Dubstep to
Me.
I ran out of
Ideas
And cool
Metaphors,
What an interesting
Thing,
This falling
Obsessed
With
One another
Is.
END OF TRANSPOSING AN {POEMS 4 NOW IT”S NOT EVN THAT LATE AN IM TIRED
RIGHT NOW IT IS 9:46:29seconds APRIL 3rd 2024, I”M GONNA GO LAY IN BED NOW
BYE.

Fucked In The Mastering Lab
u told me to do a good job for u
and it’s got me all distracted
I feel like
an idiot

cause
I can’t get any
of these stupid
mastering compressors
to work
i’ve always had trouble
with outboard gear
I gotta see the waveform on the plugin
to know if i’m doingitright
I feel so blind without it
and the guys at studio ops
already think i’m
a dumb bitch
that’s probably what they think
every week
when I show up late to my lab time
here comes that dumb bitch again
she doesn’t even know how to route the digital patch bay without our help skull emoji
laughing crying emoji red one hundred emoji
well I don’t even
care at this point

Thursday Mornings
on thursday mornings
Id pick out my outfit
carefully selecting something

that would make scotty think i’m cool
I think I succeeded
but still every week
when I get ready
i’m still thinking abt
him
Triangle of Obsession
u know i’m obsessed with u
and I know you’re obsessed with me
but i’m also obsessed with serena
and I know you’re obsessed with
her too
(cause she’s our god)
and she’s obsessed with me
and she’s obsessed with you
and I know it makes u think of
those 2 hippy girls
and it kinda makes me think of
A******* and A****
and I wonder if
it reminds serena of anyone
I can’t help but want u and her around
all the time
Feelin So Bad part one million
I was supposed to have rehearsal tonight
for ashleigh’s band
and I don’t anymore
for obvious reasons
(itjusthurtsreallybadwhenithinkaboutit)
(ithurtsevenwhenimnotthinkingaboutit)
(hersongskeepgettingstuckinmyhead)
(andthenithurtssomemore)
(buticompletelydeserveit)
(causeihurtHERrealbadrealrealbad)
i wonder if she found someone else already
or if she just canceled the rehearsal

He Can Read Me
I liked the conviction

that you had
that first day
when you said you wanted
to call me by my full name
it’s what I wanted too
and there are some things
that you just know about me
without me even having
to tell you

That One Time
that one time when u winked at me
in class
it made me crazy
I giggled to serena
like a schoolgirl

Monday Night Show Short Poem
I liked the way you moved
at the show
you like to play it cool
but I know

Good2

I get sad when u leave
and i don’t want to feel that
cause I like being alone
and I still like myself
even though I got evil
so I just have to keep saying it
being alone is good
being alone is good too
being alone is good
being alone is good
being alone is good

String
you said you think
you can feel that
your happiness is connected to me

well
i’m imagining you being tied to me
on a string or maybe a rope
and I feel like we could
have a lot of fun
if we played jump rope with it
(double dutch)
and got our heart rates up
or braided it together
to make a bracelet that you
never take off
or used it to sew back on
the button that fell off
my pants
(if the string was
thin enough) (it could make you so happy)
or maybe
it wasn’t a string at all
or a rope
it was a chain
that u cover in clear nail polish
so it doesn’t turn your neck green
and u open the window
to get rid of the nail polish smell

even though
now the room is a little too cold
(but now it’s the right temperature for
you to sleep over)
or
maybe
it wasn’t a string or a rope or a chain
but an umbilical cord
and it’s so weird
and kind of gross
but so human
and it means we eat the same thing
like an egg sandwich and coffee
(for breakfast)
earl grey tea with milk and honey
(in the afternoon)
or pasta with sauce
(for dinner) (even though I didn’t have vodka so It could have been better)
or trader joe’s takis
(when it’s late and we’re back from the show)
OR MAYB3
it IS a rope AFTERALL….!;’&&$
and YOU TIE IT AROUND MY NECK
AND IT CUTS OFF MY CIRCULATION (JUST A LITTLE BIT SO I GET A NICE HEAD
RUSH BUT I CAN STILL BREATHE FINE) AND I FORGET ALL ABOUT BEING ANYONE (ALL

OF MY THOUGHTS ARE REPLACED WITH YOURS AND I TURN INTO YOU FOREVER AND
WE BOTH GET SO HAPPY AND WE’RE BOTH SO HAPPY SO HAPPY) AND

Sundy SCARIEZ
I feel it all
It surrounds me
And there’s so
Many
So many
tHings that
I have to do
I want to do
It feels like
There's so much
Bursting inside of
Me,
I can see it
When I close my eyes
There’s explosions
Of sounds
And thoughts
And visions all
The time
And it’s so much
And it needs to come out
And there’s so much to
Do,
Its
Never enough
And I try so hard
To document it every day
But there's always more that
I need to say
To do:
Or else it might just
Be like that one time:
Where my friends girlfriend
Was getting fucked
And she got fucked

So hard
A cyst inside of her
It burst.
And no one knew what
To say
What to do
And they brought her to the hospital
And she got better,
But what are you
Supposed to do, when there's
No blood
No wound,
Just internal
Destruction. Happening
Over and over
And I don’t ever
See it
stopping.

Da Bug
It makes me so glad
That we both feel so bad
When we do nothing
You got the bug
I know you got it
Bad.
And it’s a good bug
A special one:
It’s pure; even
When its
Bad,
And I wonder if you know that
It’s just
so obvious,
And I can see it.,
So clearly,.
I just
REAlly wish we could
Both,

just
REAlize
That it could be enough
To just let go
Of everything
And we could just
Fail,
And we could be
So free,
But I can’t,.
And I don’t think you
Can
Either,
And I hate it
And I love it
And at least we
Understand each
other.

Another guy named Scott (he is not me)
I need to restring your
Guitar and
I need to finish sewing
That cat I was making for your
Mom and
I need to give you
That hat I found in my
Closet,
And I need to
Cry because I
Never did
And I never can
I told my therapist about it
And he gave my a feelings wheel
To cure me,
But when I look at it
I can’t cry
I feel nothing
I actually feel anger
I actually feel frustrated
I actually feel infuriated

That I am broken
And I thought you would heal me
And You didn’t and You Left the Practice and And I feel Contempt I Feel Unhappy I Feel
Depressed I Feel Empty I Feel Inferior and
I Feel Nothing.

Imagine a world
We Will release our book
And They will revere us
For our honesty
And for my stupidity
And for your courage
And They’ll give us
Millions
Of dollars
For just sitting down and
Writing thoughts that came into our head
We’ll be scammers
I’ve said this all before
But this is just another
Test
To see how bad a
Poem I can write
And how much I could
Manipulate
A poor fool
Into caring.

Goddamnnut
I woke up
At 2 am
Like I been
Doing
The past couple
Days
To drink
Water
Eat

Cookies
And fall
Asleep,
But I cldnt
Find the
Effin cookies,
Turns out
Luca
Fell asleep
With em
In his bed
That
Bastard.
Crooked
My glasses
Got all
Smushed
And fucked
Up at the
Last show.
So did
Elliot’s,
I guess
That’s just
The price of
Being awesome.
FrostedTipsVisitsClass
Playing ur
Mix
For the class
Nodding ur
Head
Along,.
Are you
Just brainwashed
Or can you really
Not tell
This song is
Awful and so
Dull ,..,and

It’s so disappointing
To see someone
So successful
Make something
So bad.
Nietzsche
I hear dis
Guys
Name all
The time,
I dunno nuthin
Bout him,.
When they talk
Bout him
He kinda sounds
Like a guy
I’d like,
But when people
Talk about him
I find
It
Repulsive.
Evan’s Hat
I don’t rly have
Any thoughts
At all right now
Actually,
I’m just bored
In tape class,
I am hungry,
My stomachisalways
Loud in this class
And I don’t
Like it,
Cordelle always looks angry,
Evan always has that
Hat,
I asked him if I could
Try it on,

He said yes,
It was fun,
I felt bad
Tho cuz
It seemed like he
Was losing his
Hair and
He wears the hat
To cover
It up,
Sry Evan,
I still think
U epic,
It rly don’t
Look bad.
Maybe he’s not even losing it,
Maybe it’s just a buzz cut.

2018 IndieScene
Cordelle
Played
His tape edit in
Front of the
Class,
It was a
Homeshake
Song,
I use to listen
To music
Like this
All the time,
But I can’t
Anymore;
I tried to listen
To Loving
The other day
And I just started
To hate
Myself.
To Do

I need to
Call
Marilyn
Back,
And I should call
Jackson soon,
I am not good
At keeping
Up at calls,
I should probably
Call
Brandon too,
Man if anyone
Ever reads
This besides
Adeline,
I’ve really
Fooled u,
If u read this
Far, I tricked u
Into caring about
Something so
Mundane and
Uninteresting,
Maybe I am a
Magician
Afterall.
For da First Time
I was thinking
What if today
Is the day
The big day
We fuck for
The first
Time.
I know ur on
Ur period,
But maybe that
Could make it even
Better,; blood everywhere,
It could be like a

Ritual,
We could set the
Foundation between u
N me,
Among the blood, and
We could be
Blood
Lovers.

New Guitar
Right now,
I’m sitting on
A chair in the
Home section of target,
I use to come here
All the time when
I lived round here,
Today,
It’s too cold to sit outside
So I
Came here.
It’s 10:20,
I’m waiting around
Here till 11 so guitar
Center will open
Because I fell in
Love with a guitar
There and I vowed
To make it mine,
I have to
Give Emma’s
Guitar back,
It’s the guitar I
Play the most,
I’m getting this
One
To replace
Her.

Target Bathroom
Still at Target,
I went to go
Shit,
I’d hoped I was
The only one
In the bathroom,
But nah,
There was
A guy in the stall next
To me,
I think he might’ve
Been doing
Drugs,
He was
Talking to himself,
I could see his feet under
The stall door
Shuffling around,
I seen
Syringes here
Before,
Seems like a good
Place to do
Drugs when you
Got nowhere else to go.
It’s also
A good
Place to shit
When you
Go nowhere else to go.
Drunk Poetry
Last nite,
We showed
Up to poetry
Club
Late, drunk,
I held ur hand
All the way
There.

I liked it a lot,
So did you,
When
We go to Berklee,
In the hallway,
I pushed you to the
Wall and madeout
With you,
It was fun.
Hah,
Some dweeb passed us by
In the hallway and
Gave us a thumbs up,.
We got to poetry and
We were
Drinking wine out my
Waterbottle,
We were obnoxious,
I would feel bad if it
Was just me,
But I liked that it was
us.

Still at Target 6
15 more
Mins till
I go to
Guitarcenter,
Dis gotta be
The longest
15 minutes of me life,
I’m considering
Stealing a new notebook
And some pens before I
Leave,
Seeing as,
This one is almost
Dead,
I use to steal
Cat litter

From this place
All the time.
Shakespeare 2
Whether it
Is wiser,
To buy a
New notebook
While the old
Is near death
OR
To kill the old one,
Wait for thoughts to
Start festersing,
Then get a new
One,
OR
To steal one from
Target right
Now,
DA END.

White Beanie Boy
Dis guy
Right here,
Talkin ovr
And ovr
Bout his life

And accomplishments
To anyone
Who will listen,.
Does he not
Realize,..,.,

DON CAR<E>>>>>
Snap On Shank Low Shank Adapter Presser Foot Handle
I finally
Fixed my
Sewing machine,
It had been
Broken for so
Long,
I let it fester for
months,
I spend 10 minutes the
Other day
Finally,
Looking at it, to
Figure out what
Was wrong,
Turns out all I needed
Was 1 piece,
I went on the internet
And found the
Piece and ordered it,
It only took a couple
Days to get here,
And 2 minutes
Tu put on
And it was good
As new,
And just thinking about
It, just makes
Me feel so
Relieved,
That something
So broken
Was actually
So easy
To fix,
I just had
To want

It.
Jazz Class 2
When u see ashleigh
on monday
in jazz class
u should ask her
for tips
on giving me head

CornBoy
There's a grease stain
On ur copy of
Just Kids by Patti Smith
And i wonder if you
Were reading it
While eating
A corndog

Lesgo
I’m so happy
To have a big
Penis,
If I ain’t got nothin
Least I got that,
Girls tell me
They say
You got a big penis,

Chchchchanging
I feel myself
Changing
So much
Lately,
I’m not sure yet,
If it’s

Bad or good.
I think about
How horrible I
Would seem if
Some random person
Read the things
I’ve written,
But I think
As long as
The people I care
About
As long as they
Know that
I am good,
Then I guess it’s
Okay,
But it’s still
Hard,
Not caring
About
What people
I don’t care
About
Think of me.

X:DX
It’s not
Enough
It’s never
Enough
I felt good
This morning
And I feel
Bad now.
I threw away
Feeling safe,
I threw away
Love,
I threw away
My dreams,

School is ending
Soon,
And soon,
The real
World
Will see how
Incompetent
I really
Am.

Hello Again
That Rat Bastard
Came back
Today,
But he got even
Stronger cuz,
Now he’s not
Just talking about
My creative accomplishments,
He’s telling me
That I’ve destroyed my
Life
And I destroyed
Myself,
And things
Are bad,
And I been an
Asshole
Lately,
And if he,
If we
Could do anything:
I would just
Sit in the shower
And let the hot water
Melt me
Until we turn
To nothing.
BoxedWine

It’s the
Best
When it’s
Flowing
And the pressure
Is strong
It’s the worst
When it’s
Running empty
And everything
That comes out
Grows into
A weak
Pathetic
Drip,
I wish I could
Just pay the
20 dollars at
The store and start
Over again.

Jazz Class 3
Unfortunately,
I am not in a
Optimal position
To look over at
Ashleigh
And think about how
I’m fucking her girl,
I would have to turn
Backwards,
It would be much
Too obvious.
When I walked in the class
I went to sign in
And I
Looked on the list to

See if she was here
Yet,
I didn’t see her name,
Cuz she was
Standing right behind me,
Waiting to sign in,
Sry girl,
U gon have 2wait,
Right now
It’s my turn.

Scaredy Cat
You said the idea
Of making the
Book scared
You,
Cuz you’ll be
Exposed,
Girl,. I think
I said some
Real bad
Crazy stuff,
If either on of us
Is getting
Cancelled,
I think it’s me,
Though I guess
The difference between
U and me,
Is no one cares
About me enough
To cancel me.
Uhoh Scary
I couldn’t find
My razor
Blade in the
Tape lab,
And for a second,
I swear,

I had an
irrational
Fear
That I ate
It.
Blowjob
MWAHAHAWHAHAHAHA,
My penis was
In your nmouth
My penis was
In Adeline’s mouth,
I actually felt
A bit bad
Watching you serve
Me,. it felt pretty
Good thought, and
I loved seeing it,
Today in class I’m
Gonna look at you
And play it back,.
MY PENIS IN UR
MOUTH
MY PENIS UN IN
MOUTH!!!
MAWHAWHAHAHAHAHA
Shit
Dats the end of
My journal; now,
And I don’t have any new
Poems to upload ,
And i haven’t written one for
2 or 3 days
Adn I havent written a song
In a week or two
I remember
2 or 3 weeks ago
It was all
Infinite
Poems and

Songs
And it’s not right now
And I’m, so terrified
I think I lost it,
I think I’m losing it,
I think I need to go
Crazy,
Lose my mind a
Bit,
To get it back,
Maybe I’ll just fuck
My whole life up
Agian,
And destroy myself,
So I have something
Good to talk
About,.
Worked for you,
And for me,
Maybe it’s worth another try.,
Gotta go
Ttyl.

Back on Da GRID
I brought
Back
My
Instagram
I took my
Adderall today
And I decided to
Bring back that
Old poison,
Cuz I like to burn
And I miss feeling revered
And questioning every
Single
Thing
That I do,
So I re activated my
Account,
So I can just sell

My soul again,.
I’ve already been feeling
The devil
Following me around for
The past couple weeks,.
Might as well
Just invite him in
For sometea.

Every morning
Serena asks me
If we fucked last night
And the answer is always
Yes
And she tells me
That i'm draining my
​
“Jing”
I looked it up
On google
And it said
​
​
"Jing" is sexual energy and this reduces each time a person has an ejaculation and is thus called an "energy suicide".

And she says i should take a break
So that my “Jing” can recharge
well​ i
DONTCARE
Ashleigh
One of the craziest parts
Of all this
One of the craziest things
That she said to me
Was that she wasn’t surprised at all,
That everyone thought i was evil all along
That she didnt want to believe they were right
but That
Even before anything happened,
Even before i did anything bad,
She knew
There was always
Something about me
That she hated
That she couldnt quite
Put her finger on

Dumb Rhyming Poem I Thought Of In The Shower
The choices and mistakes I made
My future looks a different way
Disgusted so i eat my shame
It's hard to just get through the day
There's things that i wont say out loud
There's things of which i am not proud
My pain dissolves when you’re around
You two are my family now

Tightrope
When I think about the
Dynamic
Between
You and me,.
It reminds me of a
Tightrope
And it feels like
Everystep
I take
Is
Intentional and
Crucial,
And even the smallest
Breeze scares me
Cuz
Then i might fall off
And die,.
But when I think about her ,
It was a
Sidewalk
And there was so much room
To
Be anyway,
And even if I fell
I would land in some nice
Grass
And I could just
Get back up,.
And I felt safe

And I’m not sure if
I do now,.
But maybe we could
Fix it,
I think we just
Need to
Melt the tightrope down
And we can spread it
Wider
And the hotter it
Gets,
The easier it will be
To manipulate,
And it’s so
Exhausting
up here
standing
In the sky,
But maybe we should
Lower it at some point,
Maybe we could put it
In between 2 trees
Like a slackrope,
Like that one you
Walked on in california,
( The literal slackrope)
(NOT the figurative)
And it could be fun
And still a bit scary
And at least then
It wouldn’t feel like
We're on the verge of death.

Underwear
This morning I woke up ,.
I slept so little
Lately,
I sweated laying there
Next to you,.
I felt gross

I been out of clean underwear for
A couple
Days.
So I went through your dirty laundry
And found a couple pairs of my
Underwear
That you borrowed.
I remember you wearing them
I remember playing with your vagina
While you had them on
You got so wet
I could feel it seeping through
I love that
You get
So wet,
And I’m wearing them now,.
Cuz I went home and
I’m still out of underwear
And dirty u
Is cleaner
Than dirty me
will ever be.

Vanderpump Villa
I’m waiting in Melissa Kelnner’s
Personal
Waiting room,.
For a zoom meeting
My friend signed up
Me and 6 of my old
Incestuous high school
Friends,
she signed us up
To get on a reality tv show
Where they send us to europe
And pay us
To eat yummy food
And be robots,.
I hope they pick us,
I just get so tired
Trying so hard to
Destroy them all,
It wld rly be nice

To just sit back
And join them
For once.
I need a new journal
To write down
All my poems
And thoughts n
Chiz,.
I haven’t had one to write in
For 2 or 3 days
An d I haven’t been writing
Poems rly,.
And it’s a nice excuse to
Not write
Because I don’t have
Anything to write in,.
But I could’ve,
Right now I’m just raw
Dogging
It,.
In the google document,.
And I feel almost
Scared
To get a new journal
And what if
Nothing comes
And I don’t have
An excuse anymore
For slowly rotting
Producing nothing
Until I became
A stingy
Oaf
Who goes on reality tv shows
And
MELISSA KELNNER HAS JOINED THE ZOOM MEETING GOTTA
GO
TTYL!<!<!<!<!<!
OhNoCondomBroke
u came inside me last night

and I can already feel
the baby growing
I can already feel
the cells bouncing around
and it’s disgusting little body
forming
I can already feel
it learning how to
contort its muscles
to make its face form a smile
how to
make its fingers configure into
a thumbs up position
and say
it’s ok
don’t worry
just take a plan B in the morning
and eat a potato onion omelette
i’ll be out of here
soon enough
I can already feel
it picking out its outfit
for the evening
finding its personal style

deciding if
it likes how it looks in a
Canadian Tuxedo
now it’s teaching itself
how to play a G5add9 chord
on guitar
and how to grip the pick
in its right hand
(which is translucent and barely formed)
deciding that it likes
those green ones that
aren’t too thick or thin
with the turtle on them
now it’s feeling bad
about itself
for the first time
(it just felt the urge to create art
a second ago)
(but it tried and nothing came out)
so now it’s trying to figure out
what to do with itself
now that it’s feeling so bad
so it paces around my
womb

and wonders if
its living right
it wonders
how to pick the right
position to lay down in
so that its neck
and shoulders and back
don’t hurt all the time
it wonders
why the fuck
is this girl not on
birth control
did she think she was gay or something?
it wonders
if its consciousness
will end abruptly
or slowly dissolve
(like the pill that’s due to be taken
once scotty gets back from cvs)

Your Eyes
When we fuck;,,
When we fucked,
I was on top
Of you,
You on your belly,
I pushed away

Your hair,
So that we could
Look straight at eachother
And we stared at
Eachother with this look,
So plain, so free
Just watching the other,
When I looked into you
It was like
Almost fear sometimes,
You looked like a deer
In headlights,
And I loved it
And I think
You did too.

Scooter Boy
A boy in my
Class left
In a hurry,
Saying his
Scooter was
Stolen,
Hah, didn’t know
U have a scooter,
Adds up
Tho.
F Moment
I was feeling
So good
And cool till
I looked in the
Mirror when
I went to the
Bathroom during
Class, f,
My hair looks
Wack today,.

And all my
Coolness,
Melted away, f,
U win again
Self hatred.

March 20th 2024 - April 9th 2024
This period
Marks the most
Prolific
Crazy time of my life
Yet to come,
This was the life span of
My biggest
Most incriminating
Best journal ,. Of all
Time, I think,.
It was 180 pages
And I used them all
And it’s interesting
How
Usually
I find myself trying to make
Things last as long
As possible,
But I the shorter the life span
Of a journal,
The better I feel,.
Because if I got a lot to say,.
Things must be going pretty good,l
Must be doing things right,.
Or actually i guess it could be
The opposite
Because things have been bad
Too,. but they’ve also
Been good,.
And it’s been so
Crazy,.
And i use that word
Over
Adn
Over
Again,. But it

S all I got right now,.
I just wanted
To dedicate a poem
To this wexford college ruled 5 subject notebook
Because we been through
So much together
And now it will live out its days
In the archives
Under my bed
With all my other journals
With all my other phases
With all my shame
And pride
Goodbye.
WAZZUPP I SEE U ON HERE>< I GOT SOME MORE POEMS IN MY NEW BOOK BUT I
DON FEEL LIKE UPLOADING RIGHT NOW I WILL LATER<> GOTTA LET THEM BUILD UP
TO A HEAD THEN LET IT ALL OUT I HOPE U R HAVING A GOOD MORNING AND FEELING
GOOD AND I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT THE BLACCENT DEBATE<> AND I THINK IVE BEEN
IDENTIFYING IT IN MY BRAIN AND TO ME IT IS A SASSY WIFE BEATER SOUTHERN BOY
ACCENT BUT I COULD SEE HOW IT CLD B CONFUSED I GUESS I WILL B MORE
CAREFUL USING IT IN THE FUTURE I DONT WANT PPL: TO THINK I AM RACIST<> I
SWEAR IM NOT RACISTS<> IF THERE WAS A LEVEL ON TOP OF CAPS I CPUL:D USE RN
I WLD OH WAUT<M> I SWEAR I:M NOT RASCIST OK I THINK I”LL STOP TYPING NOW<> I
SHOULD RLY PROBABLY DO SOME HOME WORK TODAY
hiiiiiii
I didn’t think you were racist and I came to the conclusion that it was southern
don’t worry about it too much
hope you are having a good morning I just slept in so much and it felt so good
good luck with your homework and i’m excited to see you tonight
Thank u i am excited too,. Im glad ur feeling good,. Dont worry im not feeling bad about it,. I was
just considering it in my brain,. Cld b a good poem. Okay im going for real xing out dis
document, or i think ill jus keep going.,

F
I said
“F”
out loud
the other day

and I was
disgusted
with myself.
that is
YOUR
THING.
it is NOT
MY
THING.
and I will NOT
become
you

Ok i think i got some poems in my brain so im just gonna type them here, if you open the
document just dont look while theyre in progress
What if the title was longer than the poem i think that could be an interesting idea except
im not sure what i would say in the poem its just kind of an experimental thing i like
trying out being weird, sometimes i wonder if i try too hard to be weird or interesting, and
if the fact that im trying makes it ingenuine. My parents always told me i was weird
growing up, and i always felt different, and people always said i was unique, but i still
think i tried pretty hard from an early age. I compare myself to the people that i idolize for
being weird or different, like musicians and writers and artists that i like, and i find it hard
to imagine them trying or forcing the weirdness. And i find it kind of weird to call yourself
weird, it feels ingenuine to be self aware and i always find the self proclaimed weirdos to
be cringe. I imagine that true geniuses dont think of themselves as geniuses, and true
weirdos dont think of themselves as weirdos. But i want so badly to be weird, interesting,
unique, creative, individual and i expend so much energy on it, filtering all of my
thoughts, curating my appearance, stylizing my art,
And i think
It might
Be
working

GameMasters (Alternate titles: Two of us 3, Partners In Crime 2)
I love that
You love
To play games
​
I take pride
​
In taking the party
​
Into my own hands
​
​
Making it fun
​
​
For everyone​ ​
especially me
​
​
​
​
​
​
And you
And i love that
I can look at you
And you will be ​

Walking To The Party Alone
It was exhilarating,
Walking to the party alone.
Adjusting the bottle of wine
​
​
​
In my hands
Sheathed in
Brown paper
​
​
Sometimes i’d grip the neck
​
​
​
Sometimes i’d cradle its body.
I danced in my room
before I left
As a way of
Getting high
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​

Lately ive been really into
Doing whatever
​
Makes my body
feel good

Lately ive been really into
Music that sounds
So harsh,
Dry,
Tight,
Abrasive,
And makes my body want to
Dance
​
​

​
​

So i listened to Jockstrap
Really LOUD

On the street
I ran into that girl
Sophia
Who i had a crush on
When i recorded her song once
I couldn't tell it was her at first
Because her face was
Hidden
behind her phone, taking a picture of
The Moon
​
Which i found to be sort of
​
​
Romantic
In a way that bordered on John Green Novel type of cringe
And
I remembered that
I thought of her
after i broke up with ashleigh
Because one time
She looked really hot at
A caf show
​
​
And i miss touching girls
But
I had forgotten about her
Until that moment
And she didn't
Look as hot
As she did at the show
And
Besides,
I could barely pay attention
​
To our conversation
Cause i felt antsy
​
To carry on with my quest
​
​
To see you​ at the party
So i basically
Ran There,
​
I've never had much patience with
Walking, especially
When I'm alone.
​
​
And it felt good
​
​
​
To walk in the dark

​
​
​
As fast as i wanted
And i thought
That i felt proud to
​
Be doing something alone , ​ not needing anyone
But then i realized
I was only doing it
​
To get to you
​
​
​
So by the time i got there
​
​
​
​
I was sweaty
​
​
​
​
​
And my hands hurt​
​
​
​
​
​
​
From strangling the bottle

Race guess
Why does everyone
Think im
​
Latina
I really thought
I looked
At least
A little asian
Things That Are Destroying Me
Imagining that i’m pregnant
Imagining getting the abortion
Reverse coming-out to my mom
Imagining telling my mom about anything i’ve done the past 2 months
Thinking about your song “we fucked” too many times
Imagining you forgetting about me when i leave after graduation
Being seen on the street
Imagining that i'm pregnant
Imagining us reuniting after touring and traveling and it’s so weird
Seeing aaron tomorrow in class
Having to dance with aaron tomorrow in class
Seeing ashleigh on thursday for ensemble rehearsal
Imagining that i'm pregnant
Doing my laundry
Reaching out to joseph like my therapist said i should
You getting that whore’s number at the bar
Imagining that i'm pregnant
Thinking about my old band
Seeing videos of my old band
Seeing other people in bands with their best friends
Imagining that i'm pregnant

Seeing people and imagining that they know everything that i’ve done
Imagining that i never play music with ashleigh again
Imagining that everything bad that ive ever done in boston following me to new york
Imagining us fucking and you wishing that i was her

I know
he’ll never be mean to me
I like when scotty holds hands with me
I think
yeah he could be my family
I like myself when he’s around me
i’m glad that I found him, he found me
I like when scotty makes plans with me
I think
yeah I could be his family
Love Poem

Cocaine
Last nite
It was
Nathaniels
Birthday party,
I did coke
For the first
Time,
I felt nervous
But it was exciting
I only did 1
Bump, I felt nothing,
Nathaniel did 3
Bumps,
He was high,
He got out his
Drill and
Started fixing
All the chairs
And anything that
Was broken,
I asked him to

Fix me,
He did nothing,
But when I left later
On, we parted with
A kiss on the cheek.

Bathroom Sex
Adeline came to the
Party last nite,
She brought wine,
We drank it,
Got drunk,,
Her more than me.
We fucked in the
Bathroom,
I could hear Charlie
And Nathaniel talking
Outside the bathroom
Saying my name,
I hoped they didn’t know
What
I was doing,.
They would probably be
Annoyed,
Heh, it wasn’t even
The first time
I fucked at their
House.
Plan B
While me and
Adeline were fucking
Last nite:
The condom broke,
( I didn’t realize;)
So I came
Inside her,
Later I realized that

It broke,.
She’s not on
Birth control,
Later on we fucked
She told me to
Come inside
Her,
Might as well at
This point,
In the morning I
Came inside her
Again,
Then I went to the
Store and bought
Some plan B,
Thank god for that;
It only costs 36$ to
Not end up like
Andrew.

Photoshoot
A couple nights ago,
I went to this
Photoshoot
For CUCKZINE,
It started out pretty
Tame,
They dressed me up
As a construction
Worker,
They gave me
A hardhat
And a hammer,
I Loved the
Attention.
Later they gave
Me a gun
And I loved holding
It, being
Seen with it,.
We took a bunch of
Pictures with it,

Me and Colin
Huddled over this
Twink,
Pretending to kill them,.
And I felt like a
Strong man, a
Badass,.
After,
We decided
It was time for the
Twink to get revenge
And they took a
Bunch of photos
Of the twink shoving
The gun down
My throat.
Eventually we were
All drunk
And feeling good,
They asked who
Wanted to get naked,
So i did,.
I did a bunch of
Naked photos
With Nathaniel &
A couple girls,
A couple theys,
I was hoping
I would get to fuck one
Of the girls,
There was a blond one
With a real nice
Body, I had my eye on
Her,.
At one point
We even took photos;/
Nathaniel and some
They were
Holding my balls
With chopsticks,
Thank god I didn’t

Get hard,
I loved being naked
In front of the
People, I was surprised
I felt so comfortable,
I loved the attention.
I was so drunk,
We biked over to that
Bar the Mission,
I called Adeline an
Uber to meet me,
We drank for a bit,
Went back to mine,
She’s always nervous
That I’ll I want her for
Is sex;
It’s not true,
But that nite,
It was a leading
Factor,
When we got back
To mine,
I opened a bag
Of KETTLE
Chips and ate the whole
Thing,
Then me and Adeline started
Fucking,
She kept asking if I was
Okay,
I kept insisting I was
With wide eyes,
Trying to hide
How fucked up I
Was,
Eventually I had to
Stop,
I was too drunk to
Fuck,
So instead I ate her
Out and jacked off

For old times sake.

Hello 5
I felt scared
To buy
A notebook
With no lines,
Something about
A blank page:
It’s usually too
Much pressure:
Too pristine
To make something
Happen,
But I decided to give
It
Another try,
And something about
The size of this
Journal and how
My life is going right
Not,
Feels like the
Perfect storm.
Oops
I took my
Adderall
And drank
Coffee
And left Adeline’s
Early this
Morning
(not that early,
Around 12 (but
Earlier than
She would’ve liked) )
So I could do
Homework cuz
I haven’t done
ANY for so LONG

But now I’m home
And all I wanna
Do is WRITE
AND SEW AND
DRAW AND PLAY MUSIC,
SRY SCHOOL
ALL I WANNA DO IS
SERVE MYSELFLFFFFF

Boyz don cry 2?
I wish I
Could cry
And get it all
Out,
The only things
I can get out
Of me
Are:
​
Air,
​
Pee,
​
Poop,
​
Snot,
​
Spit,
​
Cum,
And these poems,
But that one
Thing still won’t come out
And I can feel myinsides
Drowning
And sometimes it feels
Like I’m numb,
But that’s not true
Because I feel BAD and
SAD and that is
NOT NUMB,
I CAN FEEL IT ALL BUILDING AND
I THINK
I HOPE ONEDAY IT WILL ALL
COME CRASHING OUT AND IT
WILL HEAL
ME.

DA WORLD
I’m not being
Poetic today,
I’m just
Journaling my
Thoughts and fears,
It would be so
Cool if
I could just say every
Feeling and thought I
Had
And that could
Be enough for
The world.
The world wants you
To suffer
To beg for everything
You get
And to be so
Grateful when
You get it,
I wish I didn’t have to
Spend so much
Time considering
The right way to BE in
The world,
But I just can’t help but
See everything wrong
With it.
Main Character Syndrome (HipsterHeroLegend)
I oppose
All that
Which I hate,
It’s hard to live this
Way,
Sometimes I compromise,
But to reject
And insult
The ridiculous

Horrid
Mess of what is natural,
It’s so distracting
And hard
To live this way,
But I feel like a
Vigilant,
And people may think
I’m bad sometimes,
I wish they wouldn’t
But I’m actually just a
Superhero I think,
Except I spend all my time
In regular common cloth
Disguises,
( my true form is
Completely naked and I have 2 butts)
And I promise,
All I want for anyone
Is good,
And I will suffer
For u all.
RealMe
When I get
Drunk
A side of
Me
Comes out,
I think it’s
A realer
More authentic
Me
Than is usually
There,
I get so
Outgoing
And I can’t
Help but
Feel so
Disgusted

The next
Day,
Worrying
That I made
A fool of
Myself
And maybe I’d
Be better off
Being a sober
Mole in
A deep
Hole for the
Rest of my life.
Scared 2
I think I feel
So
Scared
Because
I’m still missing
Her,
While I’m falling
In love with
You,
And I can see
I think you
Love me too,
And that makes
It even worse,
Because this is
So real,
And I really
Think it was
Meant to be,,
But feeling
So good and
So bad at
Once is
So much
And I think that’s
What you saw
In my eyes when we

Woke up
Yesterday.

Jack
I find you
So cool,
I really believe
You stand
For all the right
Things,
I think you could
Save the
Scene,
I find myself
Attracted to
You,
I’m not sure
If it’s a
Crush or if
It’s respect,
But I’m happy
When you
Come
Around.
Excerpt next to a doodle in my journal
I only know
How to
Draw
1guy so I
Draw him
Overand
Overagain
Till something
New or interesting
Happens
Is it working?
Do you like
Him?
This is my

Self
Portrait
Take 1000,
It’s always
Changing
And I’m
Always changing
And I fear
The day
It stays
The same.
Mystery Boy Self-Sabotage
I been telling
People
That I’m working
On a book,
I get excited to
Tell em,
As if they’ll
Be impressed of
Think I’m a genius
Or something,
But after I tell them
I always regret
It,
Because I remember
It’s so much cooler
To be secretive
And mysterious
Like how my
Cousin use to
Tell no one he played
Guitar,
So he could unexpectedly
Pull one out and play
For a girl out of
Nowhere and
Make both her
Heart and
Panties

drop.
AloneTime
It made you
Sad
When I said
I felt scared
A bit nervous
Bout all this
Time were spending
Together,
But it’s not that I
Don’t like being
With you,
It’s that I think I
Need to preserve
Spending time with
Myself,
Because I live for
Secluding myself
At night and
Losing my mind,
And I need that time
To go crazy
And sad and create
Because if I don’t,
I don’t think I can
Be proud of myself,
And if I’m not
Proud of myself,
I’m not
Happy.
Proud Mary
There’s always
A small part of
Me,
When I go to
My friend’s shows
Hoping they’ll ask
Me to come up and

Play a song,
I usually don’t like attention
I tell myself I don’t like attention
I think I love attention,
I was contemplating
Whether or not to go
To colin’s show tonite
Till he said if I come,
He’ll bring me
Up to play Proud Mary,.
I immediately decided I’m coming
I’m so excited to be
Declared special and
Important in front of
Everyone
I’m so excited
To fulfill
My fantasy.
StatePark Show
Man,
I just
Realized
I think that sexy
Blonde girl from
The nude fuck
Photoshoot
Will be there tonight,
And Adeline is coming,
I was thinking of chatting
Her up,
I still gotta
Do my scumbag
Era
At somepoint,
I think I’m a real
Scumbag
When I’m alone in
My room,
But when I get

Outside, it
Usually goes away.
Dumb Boy (Me)
Last nite,
At Colin’s
Show,
I asked that
Naked
Blonde girl, from
The cuck
Photoshoot,
For her number
Right in front of Adeline,
It was
Dumb,
Adeline got sad,
I told her
I LOVE HER
For the first time
To make her feel better,
And I meant it too,
It was bad timing,
Such a bad time
To say it
For the first time,.
But,
She said she
Loved me too.
Good Material
I got
Somuch
Going on in
My head,
There’s prolly
So
Many poems
To come out,
But I’m just so
Tired,

I been going out
Again and
Again,
I should probably
Seclude myself
Tmrw night
To get back on
Track,
But I think about you
And it’s so
Tempting
To just
Fall into
Eachother
And
Be happy.
Matthew Ellard
I always though
You were
An asshole,
Now I know
For sure.
Journal Bus Ritual
When I write
On the
Train or
The bus,
Everytime I
Have an idea,
I pick up my
Journal:
Write it down,
Then put it away,.
I need the time
Between, without
My journal
I need time to just
Live, for
Thoughts to occur
Things to happen,

Okay, gonna put this
Back in my
Bag now.
Acting Class 2
I don’t have
The patience
For this
3 hour
Theater class
Right now,
It’s so cold in

Shorts,
Big mistake,.

Be warm in ur
Room talking,
Playing that celtic
Song u taught
Me.

Hair 3
I’m pretty
Surprised
You like giving
Me head,
I’m surprised
You let
Me cum
In your
Mouth., I love it,
I assumed your
Hair was too
Lesbian for
That kind of
Thing,
I was wrong.
Love

You already
Knew I
Loved you
Before I told
You,
You saw it when
I was flipping
Thru my journal,
U cheated;,
Maybe I outta
Read urs,
I wonder what
You had to say about
It all.

Dead People Poetry
Pat asked if
Our class has gotten better
At poems,
Everyone chimed in
How we all
Gotten better,
The more
We write,.
But I disagree,,
So long as these
Are dead people,
They will keep writing
Dead poems.
1Poem
I’m so tired
Tonight,
I planned on
Secluding
Myself
Getting
Drunk

Alone,
Thinking
Crazy
Thoughts,
Writing disgusting
Words,
But I didn’t
Even feel like
Drinking or
Writing or
Anything,
I just watched
An episode
Of game of
Thrones
And fell asleep,
I asked Adeline
If it’s okay
If I don’t write
Tonight,
She said it will
All be
Okay if
I just
Write 1poem,
And then I
Can feel
​
Good about
​
Myself:
That I’m doing
​
Okay,
OKAY:
I’M FEELING
VERY GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF
NOW, THIS
POEM IS ALMOST
OVER, SOON
I CAN GO TO SLEEP
AND ACCPET HOW
I LIVED MY
LIFE TODAY,
AT LEAST I WROTE
THIS POEM

AT LEAST ADELINE
SAID I’M DOING
OKAY,
Sometimes i just need
Someone else to tell
Me if I’m
GOOD or
BAD of
OKAY,
Cuz I can never tell
Myself.

To write
Salsa class 1
That is
A great
Idea

R we gon type
Should i call u

Soon

Yes call me in 2 minutes
But typing is fun
Yhes it is
It adds some interesting factors
Were u gon say something
Yes well im in the middle
Of doing laundry
And i need to switch to the dryer except
I lost my bag of quarters somewhere
In my room and im so
Tired and lazy and cant find it
A
nd also
Now i want to write another response poem
If u want to write a response poem,
U shoould

Last Poem of the Night
I can see
You there
Hovering over me
On the document,.
I wonder
If you're reading this right now
I hope none of the poems made you
Feel
Too bad, I hope some of them
Made you feel
Real good,l’m
Sorry I told you how I feel
About you,.
How I used those words
At such a
Weird,
Bad time,.
I said it so many times
But I swear I meant em,
I wonder if you find it
Weird,
I haven’t used them again,
I’ve thought about it,
But I just feel like I need to wait

For a good moment
To say em again,
That one was so bad,
A bit
Comical actually,
The sequence of poems about it
Is funny too
I think,
But if you do feel bad
About any of these,
About the whore
About the song,
I hope you just remember
What I said
And trust
That I meant it.

Write ur response

If u feel it
Call me when ur rady
i [m going to lay in bed.
Ok heres the response

FUCK
Sometimes with you
​
I feel like​
Im going crazy
​
I feel so
Intensely about you,
​
​
A lot of times
​
​
​
When ur aroundme
​
​
I have this heavy, opressive feeling
​
​
That it’s not enough
​
And i try to hug you so hard
And i try to press my body against
Yours
So that there is no space between

And i try to grab you
And i just keep thinking
Moremore
More
More more
​
More
And its not enough
And i feel Hyper i feel Hysterical i feel Crazed
​
And its not even really
A sexual feeling ​
(although sometimes it is)
And its barely even
Physical
I think i just get so overwhelmed
With how much i feel
That almost nothing is visceral enough
​
​
To match it
​
And I Get Sad And I Get Jealous
​
A nd I#( Get &^S ad A nd I *&G e t J:”>e alous
​
And we both want so much
​
I want you and i also want
​
EVERYTHING ELSE
​
And it gets so painful
​
​
​
I think we both feel so much​
​
​
​
And i think we flip around
​
​
​
And feel it more at different times
​
​
​
And i think we could
​
​
​
Become one of those
​
​
​
Couples that makes
​
​
​
Eachother crazy and i feel like
​
​
​
Its already happening
AND I WISH U HADNT SAID IT AT THE BAR​
I KNEW U WERE GONNA SAY IT
AND I ALMOST TOLD YOU NOT TO
BEFORE IT CAME OUT UR MOUTH
​
​
AND I DONT EVEN KNOW
IF THIS POEM IS EVEN CAPTURING THIS
FEELING
THAT I HAVE​

I see ur on hereeeeeeeeeeee
Yes I’m in the bathroom in my tape lab

Came to see if there was anything new
I wrote a bunch in my jazz class
Did u salsa yet
Nope i leave for salsa at 1
Im kind of freaking out
Aaron and i always sit next to each other
On the shuttle there
And it will be such a dramatic choice
Either way if we sit next to each other today
Or if we dont
I kind of want to get there first
So he has to make the decision
Yes that sounds like a good plan
It’s a tough decision
Best to let someone else make it
Maybe it could make you feel better
If u guy just talked but
I figure mayb you both don’t
Want that
I dunno
Yeah im not sure
Id definitely talk to him at some point
But i think if i see him ill get so mad
Theres a chance he’ll skip
I guess jus try to avoid him
And if he talks to u
So be it
What was the assignment in tape
I dunno
I just got here
Wrote a poem in the room
Then went to bathroom
I still gotta look
ALSO, reminder for myself
I’m gonna load up that Matthew Willard email
On the computer a
Nd
Format it
To print and tape it in my journal
That is so good
Yeah
People are walking in and out
A guy just came in
Singing in

The bathroom
Bababababum bum bum
I’m in the stall
Typing
Berklee,..
Haaahh
Go
I was
U first
Jus gonna say I got nothing
Else really what u got
Oh haha
Nothing else really
I was just wondering about old poems u uploaded,
U said u uploaded an old one so i tried to find it
And i found that tightrope one which i think
Was it
But i was wondering if there were others
Yes that was it
I got some more
In my journal before
New York journal
That I may look thru
Now that I done
The deed
Hah ok Maybe I’ll look thru em today
Okkkkk
Yeah i got nothing else
I came on here to look at one of my [poems to try to format it for class
Ok I’m going to go
But btw
I also draft
Good vs evil
Ohhhh yeah
Good pick
Ok bye
Back to biz
BYEEE

Walking To The Party Alone (edited for class)
Tonight I show up late and meet you there
I pretty much ran, I’ve never had much
patience for walking, or much patience for

Moving slow. Lately, I need it Fast and
Hard and Intense and Messy and Extreme.
I grip the bottle and it grips me back
Both of our necks are sore by the time i
get there, but it Feels Good it Feels Good it
Jazz Class 7? 6?
I woke up at 9:22
Already
Late,
Biked over,
Prolly 9:40 now;
Walked in,
There was Ashleigh
In the front seat,
We locked eyes
For 0.2 seconds,
It didn’t feel like hatred
From her,
But whenever I’ve looked
Into her eyes
Before, it always feels
Like there’s nothing
There,
I wonder if I’m the
Same,
Maybe Adleine likes collecting
These
Dead eye folk.
I was surprised
She was all the
Way in the front,
She usually
Hides
All the way
In the back,
I guess all the
Backseats were
Taken when
She got here,
Though I guess
Even though

She’s in the front
She’s all the way
To the side,
Separate from everyone
Else,
She never talks in
This class,
Neither do I.
I wonder if were
Similar,
If we’d get along,
I think I could be
A bit much
For her,
Maybe she’s like Maria
Hiding so far inside
And everytime you say
Something, you hope it
Was good,
Not bad,
Cuz she never gives
You much in return,.
Well, okay, that’s enough character
Analysis for today, bye,
Was I right?
Adeline is Latina
You would not
Have liked
My dream,
Some one thought
You were
LATINA again,
I would be excited
If people thought
It about me,
But I guess you think
The philippines are much more
Rare and special,
I understand,
I like holding
Onto being

Special
Too.
Bug 2
My JAZZ
Teacher
Just said
If you congratulated
Miles Davis,
Louie Armstrong,
Coltrane,
Ellington,
On all they done,
They wouldn’t
Believe u,
He says whatever
They did,
The musta had 5x
As much
Left in them and
That’s why
These “artist” types
Livesuch a ‘fractured’
‘Tortured’ life, I forget what
Exact words he used.
I feel similar
Feelings
Like nothing I ever
Do
Could ever
Be enough,
Sometimes I think I just need 1
Great song,
1 great
Album,
1 great
Drawing,
1 great
Poem,
But I always get tired
Of my creations,

I begin to hate them
And start again
To prove to
Myself I can do it,
I know there’s so
Much I want
To do
And it will never
Be enough,
But I’m not sure if
There’s 5x as much
In me at all
Times,
I gotta search
For it sometimes,
I hope all those guys
Had to search
Too,
Be cause I’d rly like to
Be like them.
Salsa Class
i’m on the shuttle to salsa class
I got here 10 minutes early
before the bus driver got here
to make sure aaron didn’t get here first
but now it’s 1:01 pm and he’s not here yet
SO I THINK I MIGHT BE THE CLEAR!
AND I SEE A GIRL OUT THE WINDOW
THAT I DANCED WITH AT THE CLUB
AND SHE IS ANGELIC
SHES A BOCO DANCER
AND I GET SOJEALOUS WHEN I READ ABT
UR BLONDE NAKED WHORE,
IT REALLY GETS TO ME,
BUT
I ALSO WANT TO FUCK RANDOM HOT GIRLS TOO
SO I GUESS IM JUST A LITTLE BITCH
THAT CAN DISH IT OUT
BUT
CANT TAKE
IT.

Salsa Class 2
it’s 1:06
bus hasn’t left yet
still time for aaron to squeak his way on here
my heart is
racing
it’s almost
time to
rejoice
but not yet
Salsa Class 3
THE DRIVER HAS CLOSED THE DOORS
AND WE ARW OFF!!
TIME FOR ME
TO REJOICE
AND DANCE FREELY
WITH THE OTHER FOOLS
IN MY CLASS
I FEEL SO LUCKY
AND I WONDER IF HE
WITHDREW
FROM THE CLASS
I think it’s very possible knowing him that he might fall into a depressive episode and fail all
his classes now

whore four
It’s a passing thought
It comes
And it goes
It’s rare
Really,.
Mostly just if I
Spot a
Whore
In the corner
I’ve only thought of it
Twice
Or thrice

Since we
Began,.
I wish you wouldn’t
Let it take
Such a toll
On ur soul
Salsa Class four
it was kinda
cold in there
but I was so glad
aaron wasn’t there.
when it came time
to partner up
I panicked
scanning the room for stragglers
while everyone seemed to find
their partners so fast.
aaron and I always partnered up
immediately,
giving no chance for randos
to claim either of us.
I dodged the worst guy in class
(clark, who is a short little freak that is
completely hopeless when it comes to dancing)
and in the nick of time
I sniped the cute wasian girl
who I always thought
looked just like my best friend
from 3rd grade
we determined that I would
be the leader
and she had a nice face
and a nice body
but
she was a little stiff
and I was a little frustrated
but
as class progressed,
I really got into leader mode and it felt
So
Good.
I felt like such a man

THE MAN
spinning her,
her on my arm,
shepherding her,
whipping her around me,
taking control
in salsa, the leader
does all the thinking,
and the follower just
gets thrown around
aaron had always been
my leader
and he was good at it
but TODAY
and FROM NOW ON
IM THE :;%$($(FUCKING ,!3&MAN*#^€

Hair 4
i’m getting my hair cut
on friday
and It’s the same cycle
over and over
where I hate my hair,
make an appointment to get it cut,
then the week before,
I suddenly love how it looks
and that’s how I feel today
except
i’m trying to remember
that I thought it was bad
just a couple days ago
and that
I need to get it cut
so that it looks good for
graduation pictures
and for london
because if my hair looks bad
then I will
Hate
Myself.

Reverse Coming-Out To My Mom

My mom has always been so
Involved in my life
​
​
​
,Almost controlling,
And i'm lucky to have
​
A mom that cares
So much
​
​
But because of that
​
​
​
I feel like i can’t do anything
​
​
​
Without telling her
​
​
​
Without getting her approval
​
​
​
​
​
And i feel embarrassed of that
​
​
​
​
​
I don’t like feeling so dependant
​
​
​
​
​
But it’s so hard to make an
​
​
​
​
​
​
Important decision
​
​
​
​
​
​
Without her telling me it's okay
​
​
I had to ask her if she thought it was okay that i quit
​
​
​
Q division, even though
​
​
​
I knew it was okay
​
​
​
Even though,
​
​
​
I knew i was going to do it anyway
​
​
​
And i almost quit without telling her
​
​
​
I tried to be strong
​
​
​
But i couldnt do it,
​
​
​
It didnt feel right,
​
​
​
I had to tell her.
​
​
​
​
And i feel like a baby for needing her
​
​
​
​
​
To sign off on anything i do
​
​
​
​
​
​
And i take what she says so seriously
​
​
​
​
​
So it really hurts when
​
​
​
​
​
She judges me
​
​
​
​
​
Or disapproves
​
​
​
​
​
It really hurts
​
​
And
​
​
I want to go on birth control again
​
​
So i tried to be strong again
​
​
And i made the telehealth appointment
​
​
On the planned parenthood website
​
​
But i canceled it at the last second
​
​
I failed again, at being strong
​
​
Because it just felt weird
​
​
Because i imagined her finding out somehow
​
​
By looking at our health insurance

​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​

​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​

​
​
​
​
​

​
​
​
​
​

​
​
My mom helped me make the doctor's appointment
​
​
Before i left for college​
​
​
And helped me pick up the pills
​
​
So i know she’s not against birth control or anything
And ive been drafting what to say to her
Because i feel like i can’t start birth control without telling her
It would feel like lying
It would feel like i'm hiding it from her
​
But if i tell her i want to go back on
​
I'm so scared of the wrath of her judgment
​
Im so scared that she’ll ask me
too many questions About it
​
About you
​
And it will make me feel so bad
​
And shameful
​
All over again
​

Reverse Coming-Out To My Mom 2
I DID IT
Crazy Couple
You said
You can
Feel us
Already becoming
One of
Those crazy couples,
Ahh,
You might be right,
The flipping,
I feel it too,.
That marathon day
Ur right it was
A perfect day,
I felt no
Fear,
Only happy,
But is
It’s crazy,
I’m okay

With it,
Fate is a bit
Cringe
, But I believe
In it.
Shower Pet 2
it felt so good to
shower with
you
I felt like I was on
a different
plane of existence
lying there
in your arms
till the hot water
ran out
ran cold
feeling slippery
feeling………….amphibian
with the lights off, everything all gray
and
when we got up
your body felt so
strong
when I touched it
when I put my arms

around it
you felt so
strong
and I love to see
the metamorphosis
that you go through
when we shower:
first,
u are a creature,
dripping,
crouched with big eyes
then
a beast with spiky hair
after you emerge from
the cocoon of the towel
and then you just get softer
as your spikes decrease
and then you are just back to
You
even though
your body is still strong
even though
your eyes are still
Creature-like​

Hair 5
Guess i’m
not a

anymore.
but I still got
my
Undercut.
Last Nite 3000
Looking back
At old
Poems,
Realizeing
1000 of
Them start
With
LAST NITE,
I guess I gotta
Start doing more exciting
Things in
The DAYTIME,
So my poems
Can get more
Original
And blend together
Less,
But I live for the night;
It feels like that’s
When all the best,
Worst, things happen,
Well,
I guess good, bad,
Things happen in the
Day,
But INTERESTING things wait
For the
Sun to go
Down.
DrugBoy

I took
Adderall
Today, first time
In what feels like
A while,
Guess it’s only been
A week or so,
But it feels good,
Very good,
Finally I have
Enough
Energy to have
Thoughts,
And enough
Energy to write
Them down,
It’s hard for me to
Imagine living
Successfully without stimulants,
I can’t wait to
Stack em all today
Into a
Substance
Milkshake,
It all compliments
One
Another so
Well.
Summer Plans
I’m going
On tour
With The Calendars
May 31st - June 22nd
And
Ontour
With AMERICAN NINJA WARRIORZ,
June 28th-30th?
I LOVE telling people
About it,
I hope that when
I say I’m doing

That, they’ll
Think
I’m SOCOOL,
I need to get
A job this
Summer to move to
NEW YORK
I will when I get back
For July and
August,
Luckily my parents r paying
My rent
When I’m on tour
CUZ IM A BABY
AND THEY’LL PROVIDE FOR ME
AND I WILL FOREVER OWE THEM FOREVER,
AND MY MOM
WILL ALWAYS
HELP ME TO
REMEMBER
HOW
DIFFERENT AND
NOTHING I’D
BE WITHOUT
TH*EM .

Iron Lung 3
I always feel like I’m

Better than everyone on
The train, for not looking at
My phone, I feel so ashamed
When I peek, I become one
Of the robots.
But meanwhile I’m listening
To music,
With my phone,
It’s just hiding
In my pocket,
Truth is, I’m just the same
I just try to hide it
From them, so I can hide it
From myself,
I got that extra appendage,
That IRON LUNG,
Just like everyone
else.
Buried Treasure
The poems
Of mine,
You think
Are good,
Are strong,
Are not always
The ones I believe
In, it makes me
Wonder how
Many lost poems
There are in
The archives
That I never even bothered
To upload
Cuz I thought they
Sucked;
How many Gagnum Style
Level hits I never
Bothered to finish.
Hits
It’s bad

That I wrote
A couple
Good poems,
And that I
Got some
Hits now,
Because now
Everytime
I go
To write one
I feel myself
Hoping it will
Be as good as
Others
And that is so
Destructive,
Dang,
Yeah,
No epic catchphrase
Is coming to me
To end this
One,
Sry.
Yellow Pages
I miss
Those rare
Yellow pages
In my old
Subject notebook,
Announcing the
¼ ,½,¾
Milestones, now it feels
Like I’m writing
In a blizzard
Got no
Clue,
Reference,
How far I’ve
Gone,
How prolific
I’m being.

Berklee Bitch Boy 2
Just heard
A guy
In the hallway,
“Derin,
What’s ur
Favorite
Mode?”
God,...
These Berklee
Bitch Boys,...
It’s relentless,....
…..Mine is
Lydian tho.
Fish Eye
I always
Love taking
Photos in those
Circular
Rearview
Mirrors
In parking garages,
Wish I could take
A picture
In one
Without evidence
Of a phone
Capturing
It,
I need a fisheye
Camera,
Wait.. I do have
A fisheye app
Tho,
We should take a picture
Together with it,
I like pictures of myself
Most when
I’m all distorted,

Not looking like myself,
But you,
You look good
All the
Time.
“F” 2
You asked
If I ever
Get ideas for
Poems I should
Write before
I write
Them
I told you
Yes,
I had one
Idea recently
For a poem about
How you said
You said “F” and
You were upset
You were becoming
Me,
Well I got it from
Emma,.
So ur either
Becoming her,
Or I’m turning
You into her,
I don’t think I
Am,
Just made for
A good poem,
But once I told you
About it,
I realized
That when you
Say it out loud:
Your idea
For a poem,

I think it dies,
So this is not
A poem
About “f”,
This is a poem
About holding
Your ideas close,
But making sure
Not to acknowledge
Them, or else
They’ll die.
Wendy’s Nap
There was
A guy
Next to me
In wendy’s
Nodding off,
Probably on
Drugs,
Sitting on a high
Stool, head
Fully tilted
Backward,
Mouth
Open,
He smelled like piss,
I can never nap
In public,
Sometimes I get an
Irrational fear that
I’ll pee my pants
When I
Fall
Alseep.

Lot of ways,
He’s brought me
To the

Drawing Powers.
Everytime I

Draw
I get
Nervous,
Especially
In the moment
Right before
My pen touches
The paper,
There’s so much
More pressure
If i know
You will see
It, cause u got
Some serious Drawing Powers
And it’s pretty
Hard to
Match
Drawing Powers 2

In my head
As I walk around
And it usually feels
Like a bummer
Cuz I usually
Forget them,
My thoughts have
Started to
Formulate
In poems
Almost
Exclusively,
I had to pullover
On the sidewalk
To write this
One down
Cuz I didn’t
Want to
Lose it,.

Shower Pet 3
Sitting in the

Bathroom,
Watching you
Shower,
I didn’t feel like
Showering,
So I sit behind
The foggy
See thru curtain
And watch.
I crouch on the
floor,
All balled up into
A nugget,.
I somehow
Always revert
To creature mode
When you’re in
The shower.
I think I like to
Feel small,
I like watching your
Naked body
Tower over
Me.
You got
A woman’s
Body.
You could step
On me
If u like.
I find you so effortlessly
Beautiful,
I remember years before
We ever talked,
I’d watch you walk in
Late
To class,
Hair all messy
And I thought you
Looked so good
And I knew you
Were just one of
Those lucky

Few
Who are blessed
With a
Natural
Fascinating
Beauty,.
And so can you rly blame me, for sitting there watching
As you stand there in the sky, and somehow
I get the chance to be the one to look up
And take it all in.

Asian Invasion
There’s an old asian
Lady on this train
Holding a bag
From a dispensary
On Newbury
St.
Don’t got much to
Say about it,
But I just nevr
Knew a old
Asian lady
Who smoked
Weed,
Now I know
They are
Out there.
Goth Girl
Saw dis
good -lookin goth
Girl walk
In the
Gender neutral
Bathroom,
R u rly
Non- binary
Or do u just
Have to poop,
Poopy girl.

The Revelation
I kept
Feeling bad
For not spending
Time alone
And
Getting drunk,
Being sad,
Not writing as
Many poems,.
But today
I feel
Okay,
I feel good
About it,
I’m so happy
Being with you,
I love you,
And here
I am,
Hungover
From last nite,
But sober,
Writing,
And maybe I actually
Don’t need to be
Sad or
Drunk
All the time.

Jazz Class 8
Here we are
Again,
I saw Ashleigh walk
Thru the
Door. She
Never sits anywhere
Where
I can sit back
And observe

Her,.
But today I’m not
Here to talk about fucking
Ur girl,
Though I been doing plenty
O that, and she like
It , hah, sry,
What I wanna
Talk about
Is loving her,.
And I know that you
Hate her,
I’ll take over ur duties,.
I’ll loveher,
I been
Loving her,
For a while now.
And I know you
Say
You want nothing to
do wither, which is prolly
Tru,.
But I’m sure there’s a
Small part of you,.
Hope’s she’s
In good hands and
She is,
Maybe you think she deserves
To have bad things
Done to her
For what she done
To you,
But trust me,
She’s been punishing herself
Plenty,
But if you like
I’ll give her some
Spankings tonite
For you.
I’ll degrade her,
Spit in her mouth,
Slap her cross the face

Till the devil jingles
Out of her, don’t worry
Bout a thing, Ashleigh.
Sex Face
You make this
Face when
You sing,
I got to watch it
The other nite
At your show,
You looked so good,
I felt so proud
To be yours.
You make the same
Face when I
Fuck
You,
And I feel so proud
That only 2
Things:
Music,
Me,
Can get you
there.
Brad
Ur moving
Away,
I’m moving
Away,
I’d really just like
To
Say,
Thank u mr.
Gay.
You taught me the
Right way
To play,
The right way to
Say, to be

Brave, to be honest
To be unrelenting,
To have morals,
To oppose those
Who don’t,
To oppose
All the
Machines,
To be a good
Friend,
To be
Interesting,
To do things
For the right reason,
To read,
To keep learning,
To keep writing,
To go crazy,
To stay sane,
To ride the
Line,
To care,
To not care,
To be a
Messy boy,
With messy
Hair,
To hold on
To your dream,
To do what you do
For yourself
And for 4 or 5
Buddies,
To be the light
In the darkness:
The unwavering
Beacon of
Righteousness in the
World
Tonite,
Thank u,
good bye.

Drawing Powers 3
There was this girl
At cuckfest, selling drawings,
She’d do em right
There,
Called em
“Goober drawings”
Me and Adeline
Did it,
Cost us 5 dollars..
While she drew
Us, I drew her,
At the end we revealed,
Hers was boring,
Cute idea,
But awfully dull,
Mine was good,
She said I should
Be the one doing it, joking,
I didn’t say this,
But she was
Right,.
I was much better,
More interesting
Than her,
One thing I will allow myself
To be confidentin,
Is my drawings,
I love my style, it has
Been in development for
Years, I wish I could love myself
The same way I do my drawings.

Lost n Profound (sry for da gay title)
It’s been so long

Since I wrote
Something profound,
God I’m so
Behind,
I just been
Writing boring
Updates in
My head,.
There was a great
Profound poem in the
Cuckzine, and the
First thing I always
Think when
I see good art
Is; I need
To do it
Too.
Jazz Class 9
Class ended,
I was putting my jacket
On,
Putting my journal
Away,
I look across the
Room
To glance at
Ashleigh when she leaves,
I see her
Walking out,
I bet she’ll keep
Her head
Down,
She always
Keeps
Her head
Down
As she walks.,
But this time she
Tilts it to the
Side the
Smallest fragment of
An angle

And shoots me with a side
Eye: !
Finally, I’ve been anticipating
This for a long time,
Her glance, it
Was hateful,
If I had time
I would’ve shot back
A look
Of empathy.
I know her
Life sucks
Right now,
I would’ve
shot her with
Love,
But I didn’t have
Time
In that small moment
All I could do
Was watch.
Bike Rack Lock Thing
Whenever
I bike to
School,
I always park
It outside the
150 building
In this row of
Bike lock rack
Things.
There’s this one:
My special spot,
It has the remnants
Of a stolen bike,
A single wheel
Is locked on,
It’s been there for
A while,
A year
At least,

No one dares
To park there,
But I always
Park there
To see if history will
Repeat itself,.
To see if people
Can change..
So far so good,
I hope they can.

thank god

but it barely even matters
cause I feel
So
Bad.
I tried to sleep
last night
but when I layed in bed
I only thought of my
guilt
of my
shame
and so
I went on my phone
so I couldn’t
think anything
feel anything
and it worked a little
so I didn’t put it down
and I scrolled
into
oblivion
I scrolled
until I was
unconscious
IUD Cramp
I guess I feel
a little cramp
but my anxiety hurt
so
much
more
IUD Cramp 2
I spoke too
soon.
IT HURTS SO MUCH
FUCK!
Watching You
Today in class
I look for you in the piano,
like you wrote about
looking for me

in it
that one time,
but
it’s my turn now
to watch you
and you look
so good.
I go back
and forth between
your reflection,
hoping to catch
a glimpse of your
face when you
look up
at pat
and then back
to you,
your body reclining
back in your chair
sometimes
or hunching over
your journal
sometimes
and it’s just
nice
to look at.
as I
watch you,
I remember
how it felt
to wonder about
you
to wonder what
you were like
when u were
a
Mystery Man
Cool Guy In The Corner
I spent so much time
wondering
about you.
and it’s
surprisingly easy
to look now
and pretend

I don’t know
anything about you ;
even though
we walked here
together
even though
we spend almost
every night
together
even though
i’ve seen the poems
you wrote
about me
even though
I know you
and
I love you
and
everything has changed
so much
but
you feel
so good.
Mae from Poetry
Today,
Mae told me I look like
Austin
from the backyardigans
and that
she had been thinking
about it
for a while
I wondered how much
she looks at me
she thinks about me
Charlie
Should I ask him
to be in my
band?
I can’t really think
of someone
else to ask

but for some
reason
I feel really nervous
to ask him
Watching you 2
I was looking
At you too,
Not sure if you
Noticed but
I thought we locked
Eyes in that
Piano,
Ur not obstructed
Today by
Blonde sippy cup
Baby girl.,
I thought we were
Locking eyes
So I stuck out my
Tongue as
To say hi,
But no response,
Maybe the piano is
The place:
A rare location
Where we can
Just stare at
Eachother,
With no acknowledgement
Of one
Another,
And it feels
Good.
Charlie 2
If you
Want I can
Just ask him
For you,
But even if not,
There’s nothing

To feel nervous
About;
I promise,
No matter
What,
He will be
Feeling more nervous
Than you
Ever could.
Mae 2
I bet she thinks
About you
All the time,
I wouldn’t be
Surprised if
She has,
What’s it called…
Oh,
A shrine
With photos of
You,
Alongside,
Candles,
And she reads
Dark philosophy to
Photos

IUD Cramp 3
The cramping
Is Mild
But
I feel like
I might
Faint.
I wonder
How much of it
Is from the cramping
And how much
Is from the sickness
And how much
Is from the shame

Alone Time 2(?)
I got so
Many things
To do
When i'm alone:
Journal
Mix my song for class
Cook dinner
Practice the Ninjas set
Plan my trip to europe
Call sarah
Clean my room
Do my object write
Repair my relationship with Serena
But
When im left
To my room
With just myself,
I get too sad
And forget
All else
Exists.
And i really think
I need to
Fix that
About myself
IUD Cyborg Girl Operation
I got this piece of
metal
in me now .,
make sure
next time
u fuck me,
u show me
it was
all
worth
it

Text Back
I didnt text u
Back
Cause i couldn't
Rly think of anything
To say
And i didnt want to seem
Boring.
I'm still thinking of what
I could’ve said.
Really,
I have nothing to say
And if we were
Together
It would just
Be one of those
Long, drawn-out
Moments
Where we just
Look into each others
Eyes.
Yesterday
During one of those
Moments,
You said i had a
Benevolent
Look in my eyes.
I looked up the word
Just now
And it defined it as:
well meaning and kindly
And if i could
Give you a
Benevolent
Look right now,
Instead of coming up with
A text back,
I would.
My special obscure song
Charlie posted

A instagram picture
With this song
My favorite song
Right now,.
I love
the song
I hate
When people steal
My favorite song
That was mine
Boy.,,
Ah
Fine
Guess u can
Have it
I jus felt proud
Showing people
I found a cool song
I guess
Now it’s ur turn to
Feel cool
When u show people.

Best day evr
I needed time
Alone
To feel
Bad and
Sick
And eat
Soup. And watch
Game of thrones
And fall asleep watching
It
And I was glad
To be alone,.
But now
As I’m getting ready
To go
To bed,.
I wish I
Could make you

Teleport here
So we could
Fall asleep
Together.,,,
We always stay
Up too late
I need
The rest,,
So mayb I
Wish I could jus fall asleep
Right now in 1
Milli
Seconds
And transport to the moment I
Wake up
And we could look at eachother and
Touch each other
And talk
If we
Feel like it
Maybe you could heal
Me,, maybe we could heal
Eachother
And I’d also like to
Add
That in the morning
Each
Minute would be
One hour
And we could do whatever
We wanted to
We could rest
In
Bed,
I wouldn’t have to feel
Bad for laying around past a certain time
We could
Relax,.
Make a music video,,,
Go to the woods
And eat that acid that’s been
Sitting in my drawer
Waiting for an opportunity
Like this..

Time would be
Moving so
Slow
Ly,
We could go outside and
Watch all the people move
1 centi
Meter.
Per
Second,
We could go to
Jaime’s house and
Take off her clothes and
See if we really
Want that threesome
We could
Go take off
That one girls
Clothes
Who we don’t
Know
But she works at the studio ops
Desk and
We both think she’s
Cute..
We could do all the things
We’ve been meaning to
Do,
I could help you
And you could help me
And by the end
Of the day,.
I would’ve been so
Satisfied
That I wonder if I
Could even
Find the point
In living
The next day,.
I would’ve done everything I ever needed
To,, sometimes when I go on planes
I get scared if it shakes and I just accept
That if I died I did enough but when I get to
The floor it all starts over again
And nothing is enough and maybe if we both

Just accepted our demise we could let
Go of all these horrible feelings that plague
Us in our seclusion..
Am I projecting
Do you feel it too?
I think you do.

YES YES YES YES
I feel it too
Started from da bottom 2
I can’t believe it
When I fell
In love with you
You had
A girlfriend
A best friend
You were in love
With.
Some how
Now,
I’ve made you
Mine,
They’re all
Gone with
The wind,
And to top
It all off
I get to
Fuck you
With no
Condom,.
I must
Have some
Serious
Powers,.
What do u think
I rly put

Sad Sick Gray Day
You’re sick
serena is sick
and so am I
and i’m bleeding slightly
and serena’s been
sobbing
in her room
since I got home
30 minutes ago.
both of you
stayed home
today
no one to drum with
in class
no one to peek at
through the window
(even though I went to peek anyway with the smallest hope that you had been
revived and magically teleported to your ensemble)
I feel pretty strong
and Powerful
since my body still
feels pretty
good , even though
I got the same
disease as you2 fools
your bike is
still locked
outside my place
and I like
seeing
it
every time I pass it.
I wish I was
seeing you
tonight
I was going to bring

you an orange
to heal you
so that you will
have your full powers
for poetry tomorrow
but im using my
mind instead
to send it to you.
is this the longest amount of time we’ve spent apart from eachother ?
it feels quite
long.
today,
I imagined
us saying goodbye
after graduation
I also tried
to imagine
you
in a cap and gown
and I couldn’t quite
picture it.
there were many
other things
that I imagined today
such as:
having sex with you.
I think
our jing
might be
recharged
by now,
and im
excited.
there isn’t much
substance to this poem,
I just
Miss You.

The Cave
There was a cave on the side of the main road in my town

And when i was a kid
I used to imagine that
if i ever became homeless
I would move into the cave and live in there.
It was actually more of a fantasy,
and I would tell my parents that
If we ever lost our house, I had a plan.
and they would tell me don't worry,
we’re not going to lose our house,
and I thought that was a little too boring of an answer.
I secretly craved for something bad to happen to me
and bad things definitely happened,
devastating things,
some things out of my control,
and some things completely driven
by my own mania.
The cave is on the side of the road
that you take to get to my house and
I still always look at it because
it’s on the right side and
I always sit on the right side of the car
if I have to sit in the back.
And sometimes I let my brother
sit in the front seat so I can
sit in the back seat and be
alone with my thoughts.
I only went to the mouth of the cave once,
when i got some courage,
but when i went to go inside
I saw that it was filled with trash.
I was so disappointed.
When i look back, i wish that
I would have just cleaned up the trash,
old soda cans and plastic bottles,
so that i could venture deeper
and maybe i still will do it.
There is a little plaque
on the side of the cave that
​
talks about how native americans lived there
and how there were arrowheads found inside.
​
It said it goes back pretty deep and
the ceilings aren’t very high.
I never mind being in small spaces
and i like the idea of squeezing myself

into a dark place where no one’s ever been.
I think i could go so far into the cave
and stay so long in there that my skin
would become translucent, and
maybe my cells could even
evolve to produce their own light.
The soft glow of my body could be
enough to illuminate the inside of the cave,
just bright enough that i could
use a mixture of spit and charcoal and dirt
to draw cave drawings
depicting all the evil things i've done,
and that would probably work as an act of penance.
I could be fully good
by the time i come out of the cave
and i would have also made so much beautiful art
to purify myself
and have something to show for living.
And then I could slowly
learn to live in the real world again,
my body’s glow would dull
and the color would come back to my face
and I’d maybe even get a tan.
Everyone would tell me how healthy i look
and how much they missed me while i was gone,
and how much of a good person they think I am.
No one would look at me weird on the street anymore,
They would look at me with love,
And I could even look in the mirror,
And look at myself with love too.

Tik tok Legend

There was this
Guy I saw
At Adeline’s show
Last week
I didn’t like him
One bit
Classic indie
Bitch boy
For starters,
Clearly
A tik tok
Legend,. Very
Chic,. Trendy, flare
Pants, depop boy..
But more than anything
It was this twisted
Look,
This side eye
He shot me with every time
I passed him
I decided right then
For sure
He was an, asshole
And indie
Prick
Boy,.
I almost enjoyed
Shooting those
Hateful glances back
And forth
The way he dressed
Made me feel
Confident
I could beat the
Boy,..
He was taller than
I ,.
And I ,.
Never been
In a fight before,
But I have this phantom
Confidence when

It comes to these
Kind of things,
When I think
About it
It reminds me of a timer,
I know it’s coming,
One day I’ll just
Lose it
And fight someone
And I think it will feel good,
Every once
In a while someone
Will do something
And that look
That stare will
Jump out of me
Like a snarling
Dog,
Forgive me,. For that
Good word usage,. It goes against
Everything ,. I believe in,
But it happens
Every once in a while,
Someone does something
And me and another
Guy will
Engage in this
Staring standoff,.
In this moment
I pray they’ll
Make a move
So I’m forced to respond,.
I love in these moments
When people
Have to pull me
Away,.
I feel so tough
And dangerous.
It happened again later
That night
At THE BURren,
Me and Adeline and Oscar
Were dancing, I think we bumped into a guy
He shoved me

Over the line amount of
Hardness,
I shoved him back
And began the stare,.
God I would’ve loved to fight him
I coulda beat the
Boy,
I know it,
I was slightly drunk
When I get drunk
I have this sneaking urge
To fight,
It would’ve been
So juicy,.
Adeline pulled me away,
I keep looking back
At him
To shoot my evil glance
Its such
A look of disgust
But I think we all love it
I think it’s a mutual thing
In the same world
As eye
Fucking
Some girl
At a bar
Not that I’ve done it
But I’ve heard about it
In movies
And on TV,.
Too bad me and him
Didn’t get the guts
To just fuck and fight
And be all strong and
Tough.,
And what made me
Feel like writing this
In the first place
Was when I was thinking
About those disgusting
Looks
Indie bitch boy
Gave me

At Adeline’s show,
And I realized I do
The exact same thing
And maybe were the exact same
Boy ,
And I sure hated him.
And maybe that’s why I hate
myself.,

Bunch o poems from my notes app archives!!!!
I rly do (3/28/24)
Love life
Even wwhen it sux
I find pretty much
Every part
Of it
Endlessly fascinating
And rewarding
Too,
Sometimes.
Someone (3/30/24)
On this bus
Is listening to
A video of a baby crying
On full volume,.
It is a bit
Annoying
When it’s real
But I understand.,
But when it’s a video
I find it despicable
And I think
U deserve
To die.
I’ve always (3/30/24)

Bit my fingernails
My whole life
I love
Doing it,
I remember
Right around when we were
About to
Break up
I would bite them
Till they bled,;
Sometimes I wonder
If I made a mistake
But my fingernails
Say otherwise

If I was king (3/31/24)
Of the world
I would make a
Law that anyone who
I ever
Liked,
Loved,
Dated,
They are never
Allowed to have
Sex with anyone else
Forever,.
Even if I don’t
Want them
They must
Sit patiently
And wait for me to return
Even if
I never do
Once they are touched
By me
The were and
Always will be
Mine.
17 (4/1/24)

I kept thinking of it
On the train
That number
I don’t know why,.
I was so bored
I told you to try
To guess
What number I was
Thinking of.
You said
17,.
It was effing
Crazy
I promise it happened
The end.

I loved it (4/3/24)
When you wrote
Fate is cringe
But you
Believe
It.

Sitting in Josephs (4/3/24)
I’m so glad
That devil woman
Isn’t here
Instead it’s that
Spanish guy
30 40 50
Or so
Last time I saw him
I was drunk
And I told him
I liked the song
He was playing,
He always plays good
Music, :
Some spanish

Chiz
Columbian,
Dominican Republic,
I dunno,
But I like it,
Maybe Guatemala,,
Hope it’s not
Racist to have
These thoughts.,
Sry,
I don’t think it is,
It’s just my honest
Ignorant
Perspective,
I’m on my phone typing
This,
I hate being
On my phone
In pubblix,
Wish I could talk to him
Good
In Spanish
I tried before,
I wasn’t too good,
I think that’s the end.,
I asked for. A meatball
Sub
Now I’ll wait
Staring out the window
Not looking at my phone
Like a profound
Little
White boy.
Back on my phone (4/3/24)
Still at
Joseph’s
Waiting,
Just had a thought
That I love you
That I’ve loved you
Ever since
We started exchanging

Those glances,
I broke up with
My girlfriend
For you
I knew I loved you
So fast
It’s crazy,
I think you might too,
What a crazy thing
This is,
What a awesome thing
To experience.
Back to my profound
Empty silence
Back to
Staring out the window
Now.
I’m so (4/19/24)
Fucking
Tired,.
Fuk u
Charlie
For booking this
Fucked up session
And being
30 minutes late
God I just want to
Sleep.
I’m so (4/29/24): – REBUTTLE
If u ever
Read that one
Charlie boy,
I didn’t mean it,
I wasn’t mad at you,
I never have been;
I was just so tired
You booked a 2-6am
Session,
But you were late
Because you were making

A screen for me,
Thank u for doing that
I love u,
I hope if you read this
You giggle,
I hope u don’t feel sad,
I was just
So tired,
I remember though,
I had a lot of fun
At the session,
I really did.
I remember
I was gonna sleep
At Adeline’s after
But when the session was done
I had
Had
So much fun
I hit a new wave of energy
I couldn’t go to sleep
I biked home
Made 2
Corndogs,
Watched game of thrones
And then
Went to sleep,
For only 4 or 3
Hours,
Woke up,
Printed shirts
Sewed sweaters
Cuz
By now it was
4.20
And we had the
Cuck show
And it was such a good
Night,
I had a beautiful time
With my friends
And with Adeline by my
Side,
We played last

And I brought up all
My bff’s to sing
Our theme song,.:
American ninja
Warriors are
We’re not tough guys
We’re not that wise
But we got thoughts too
So we sing about stupid
Situations were in
Internal disaster
With some minimal laughter
Will usually
Do.
And dis right here is the theme song,
So sing along
If ur a warrior too.,
We don’t like salad,
We love junk food,
We love playing games with our friends
And laying in bed
With girls
Nude,
So if ur feeling lonesome,
If ur feeling blue,
If u got
No one around
Just know there's a crowd
Made just for u,
And dis right here is the theme song,
So sing along
If ur a warrior too.,.,
Epic riff, then the end
It was so sweet
If I could cry
I would’ve.

Salsa Class 5?6?
It was the last class
today
and I got to dance with
the cute
gay guy,
boco theater major,
who I find
incredibly attractive
although his name
is elvis
which is not
incredibly attractive.
when our bodies
were close
I thought that
he smelled like
you,
strangely enough.
he must have
the same
cologne or
deodorant.
I wondered
what it would be like
to dance salsa with
you,
how I invited you to the club
before I knew you
although i’m not sure if
you would like it.
i’d like to dance with you,
but I can’t imagine you
doing the moves.
it was such
a big thing
that me an aaron did
used to do
i’m not sure we
would’ve fucked
if not for salsa.
at the end of class,
elvis asked

what happened to your friend?
did he drop the class?
and I said
I don’t know
we don’t talk anymore.
one last detail
i’ll include is that
I saw today when
his shirt came up
that he had
a SIXPACK

Dew
When I listen to his
Music
I feel so doomed
He really must
Have some sort of
Angels
Following him around
What do they call that,
A muse,?
The great songs,
They just keep coming
They don’t stop
He’s a genius,.I really
Believe
that.
And sometimes it makes me feel
Bad.,
That i’m not as
Good
As him.
But one thing that makes me
Feel better
Is
I may not

Have angels following me
Or a muse,
But I can be a
commoner,
a mere
Mortal,.
And maybe I can lean into
It,.
And just be so honest
And transparent like a peanut
Butter
Sandwich wrapped in seran wrap
And I can dangle it
At a contemporary art
Museum and maybe
It could be good enough
Just to be
Myself.

Little Boy
Should I make
1 or
2 hot dogs,
I can’t
Decide
I’m not that hungry
But my body probably needs
2,.
I still cant decide.,
I thought about
Calling you
And asking you
To tell me
What to do,
But I think I’m gonna
Try to
Be a man
and
Make this decision
All by my
Lonesome.

Benji - SunKilMoon
I love this
Album
It reminds me
Of
Falling in love
With
Adeline,
Biking home,
Walking home,
When she wasn’t ready
For me to sleepover.
It reminds me
Of riding
The bus
To New York,
Taking the bus
Back,. Thru
The night,
Getting back to
Boston:
Getting locked out of my
House,
Sleeping at Berklee,
It was rainy,
I took the E back
And showered, make breakfast
And fell
Asleep in my bed.
Poem about MYFEELINGS
I feel like I
Can’t write
Can’t do
Anything without
Hurting you,
I wish I
Could do
Whatever I want
Whenever I want
But I think

I feel bad for
Everything and
Anything
I feel bad for
Writing this,
I feel bad for
The things
I’ve done,
For the things
I haven’t done,
I use to worry
About feeling
Numb,
And I might not
Cry, but
Trust me,
I’m not
Numb,
I feel so much
Too much,
To get anything
Done.
Bad Things
You said
You always
Wished something
Bad, something
Horrible
Would happen to
You,.
So did I,
Difference is,
It actually happened to
You,
And I wonder
If you came to your
Senses,
Or if now
You crave
It.

Comic Idea #1
I was so
sick I
Slept for 24
Hours I never
Did that
Before,
I started
To sweat
So much
And it all
Poured into
This strange
Tube I hadn’t
Seen it
Before
I wanted to make
It full, I started
Pouring all my
Fluids into it
I did some spit
I tried some pee too

​
​
​

Even didd
​ `​
​
​
​
​
​
​

some cum
And some
​
Snot I had
So much to spare,

At this point I decided
My special potion
Should have all my
Bodily fluids,
I pricked
My thumb
And dropped
Some

Blood in,
It was getting
Pretty full,
I just needed to add
Some tears,
But they wouldn’t
Come,
I forgot how to
Do it,
I forgot how
2 years
Ago,
So I just sat
There for a minute
Trying to thing
Of sad stuff
But I failed
I got better a
Couple days
Later,
And I forgot all
About my special
Bucket,
​
​
But when I checked
​
back , a fetus
​
​
​
Was in there
It was
Really little
And alien looking
And I liked it
I didn’t want it
To Grow
ANYMOR
So I pulled
It out and
Put it in
My
Backpack,.
All the cells were

So malleable
So I stretched
It out and made it
Into a scarf,.
Everyone started to
Compliment me so
Much on the street
Asking where I got
It,
I only told a few close
Allies,
But before I knew
It,
People cross the land
Were pouring all
Their substance into buckets
Crafting their very own
Fetus,
I even started seeing them
On depop,
And shortly after there
Were all these substance
Bucket factories, with human sacrifices.
At this
Point
I couldn’t bear
To be seen
With such
A commonplace
Item,
So I threw it
In the trash,
And then
I started
Throwing everything
In the trash
Everything I owned
​
And stomping and
​
Crushing until
All my possessions
​
Were a dust

And so I snorted it
​
All up
And forgot all about
It,
But over the next few
​
Weeks I felt
Everything reforming inside my
Belly,
​
​
And that old
​
​
Fetus friend
​
Of mine built and
​
​
​
Built until
​
​
He had his own
​
​
House in my belly
​
​
​
And I began
​
​
To burst
​
​
​
I began
​
​
​
To die
​
​
Till he was no
​
​
​
Longer
Mine and
​
​
​
​
I was
His.
​
​
​

Until one day
​
He opened
The front
​
​
​
Door,
And walked out of
​
​
My belly.
And then
​
​
He threw me
​
​
​
Away.

Jazz Class 9? 10?
I don’t have
​
Much to
Say, at this point
I’ve won,

​
​
​
​

Not that you wanted
​
To win,
Or cared
​
For losing,

You really think she’s
​
Evil,
​
Huh,
She did do a
​
Bad thing,
But I don’t see
​
Evil in her
​
​
Daybyday,
I think you
​
May
​
Be confusing
​
​
Self-destruction
​
With
​
Tru, ill-will,
I wonder when
​
​
She’ll blow up next,
​
​
And if I
​
​
​
Will burn with her.

Leon Dorsey
My JAZZ
Teacher said
We have 2 more
Assignments
For the end of
The semester:
1.​ Dream big
2.​ Be great,
He does it every semester,
The first time I saw him
Do it,
He teared up,.
It’s a bit

Corny but
So sweet
And I think
I needed to
Hear it.
Art
Sometimes I
Wonder if I
Need to
Do it,
Or if I just want
To have done
It,
But I guess so long
As I done
It,
It doesn’t matter
Where it came
from.
​
Fake Poet
I love to read your poems
I come back on here
​
All the time
To read them
Again and again
And i hate
When i scroll past
Catch a glimpse of
One of the poems
That i wrote,
I scroll as fast as possible
When I see one come up
I hate reading them
Seeing them
I feel Disgust.
There are only 2 or 3
That i actually
Like.
​
I don’t feel like a

Real poet,
And if i had to guess
And you’d probably say
You don't feel like a
Real poet
Either,​
or maybe you do feel like one
I'm not sure,
But you seem way more
Real
Than me.
​
​
I don’t write the way you do,
​
A lot of times,
​
​
I think of adding to this document
​
As a way of giving you
​
​
A gift, entertainment,
​
​
​
Because it feels like
you give me a gift
​
Every time there’s a new batch uploaded
​
And i want you to experience
​
​
The thrill that i get
​
​
​
From getting to read
​
Your deepest,
Most personal,
Most profound,
Most mundane,
Most interesting
Most genius
Most trivial
Thoughts.
​
​
​
Ever since you
​
​
Had the idea
​
​
To do the compilation,
​
I had a feeling
It was just because
You loved me, that you wanted to include me,
​
Just because you wanted me
​
​
Involved with you in some way.
I've always thought
The book would be better off
​
​
​
​
Just you,
​
Better off without me
Polluting the pages
​
With my phony poems
​
​
​
Ok,

​
​
​

​

Maybe you could put the fish one
And the cave one
​
In there, but
​
​
My roster is weak.

Call 3
I called u today
Cause I felt all bad
And I thought it would
Feel good to tell you
About it
But it was good that
You didn’t pick up
Because when you help me
I feel mostly good,
Except
It comes at the price of
Feeling disgust,
Feeling embarrassed,
That you know everything
That I need so much help.
I don't
Want to
Talk
About this
Situation
Anymore
I don't
Want to
be a baby
That needs
Help
Anymore
I want to
Be someone
I want to
Show you
I can
Be someone
That can
Not destroy everything
That doesn’t
Need so much

Help
After she destroys everything
I want to
Be a real
Girl
A real good
Person
A
Good girl
A real
Good
Girl
Good
Person
Who can
Make
Good choices
Or at least
Deal
With the bad
Choices
After
They’re
Made
And i don't
Want
You to worry
When
I’ll
Destroy everything
Again
And
How i’ll
Destroy
You
With
Me.

I’m stuck on this side of the page ,.
I don’t know
How to get back

Over
I don’t know
How long
My phone will
Last before it
Does
I don’t know
If I will revive it
The whole time I’m
On this
Road trip
We’re driving
To philidfia I’m
For Charlies
Show,. I’m thinking
About Adeline
I wish she was here
Next to me,, we had a good
Night
And a
Great.
Morning
Too.
I thought I’d
Be writing
Many
Poems on this
Car ride but I don’t
Much
Feel
Like it,.
The sun is out
I need to wait for
The sun to go down
And the monsters to
Come out and
Eat me all up
Maybe I’ll write some
Tonite in my journal
As I stay at
Ashleigh’s grandmas
House,,
It will be jazz class

11,. It’s not jazz class
But being in the same
House as Adeline’s ex
Counts in my head.,,
Aight the end
My phone gon die
Wish me luck
On my journey

disorder
When I was a kid
They told me
They said
I was dyslexic
Some one said
That,. I said that,.
They test me
They say
That I got
This thing
That’s called Dysgraphia,.
Y’know maybe their right
But I don’t think
They know a thing
And I’m starting to learn
I think I know alot
I think I can be smart
Too,.
And I dont’ think i got this
Dysgraphia
I think ur wrong
I think I just got
Style.

The poet 2
What a sacrifice

It is
To be a poet
To be a writer
To be good:
Is to speak the whole
Disgusting
Truth
And i find anything else
To be
Cowardly,.
It’s important to note
It will not always be
Cruel, or vile,.
It may rarely
Be cruel ,. Or vile,.
But if it’s in you
You must admit it
You must give it to
The page
Because if not
You aare a liar
You are
Propaganda.,
To be
A writer
A true
Poet,
It seems
You must
Be canceled
At least 3
To 4
Times,;
It really is a social sacrifice:
To live
So boldly,
So horrifically
Honest,
And i know
You got a head start
On that, but
I'm sure I’ll catch up

At some point.
Not because I’d like
To be one
But because
I think,,
I believe,,
I am one.

Closing statement (more to pitter out afterwards)
This book,,
We said
It must come
To an end,
It must come to an
End,,
At some point
The point
It’s coming
Sharpening..
You are leaving
For two months
In 6, 7 days,,
I will miss you
I do not believe
This is the end,,
But i do believe..
I think,
This book
May be
Soon over,.
I feel like
It could go
Forever,,
I could document
My whole life
Like a great big
Epic poem,

And right now
I plan to,.
But I have the feeling
When you leave,
A new chapter:
A lonesome chapter
Will begin
This book
Was not intended
To be about you
About us,
It: is about other things as well
It’s about everything
But it seems,
That has become to
Main plot,
And while that plot
Will continue
I think this chapter may
Be ending
And a sequel may be
Beginning,
What do you think?

Poetry
Is
A way
Of life
It is
The
Philosophy
Of life
It is learning
How to
Live
Questioning
How to
Live
It is hatred
Of others

It is obsession
It is love
Of the world
It is anything
It is bad
It is rarely
Good
It is so
Good
When it’s
Good
I did it all
For me
I still wish
You all
Will think
It’s good
Please
I beg
Declare
Me your
King
And worship
Me
And give
Me
1000
Dollars.

Job hunt
I need a job
I need to apply
To a job
I’m planning
On moving
To New York
So I can further
My identity
As a hipster
Bitch boy
And make
ARt!!!!

But I need
A job
I heard
It’s all so
Expensive,,
I can’t wait
To apply to
Work at some
Studios
So that I can
Be there

Most days
And beg
For their approval
So that
I could accomplish
The rare opportunity
Of working with
Musical legends
Justin beiber!
Beyonce!
Adele!!
Plz hire me
I studied real
Hard
I went to
Music school
Please award
Me this opportunity
To work this
Bad job

Spiraling Out Mystery Girl Goes To Pharmacy
It won't feel very good
Being a
Mystery girl
To ur parents
I dont want
To meet them
I told my mom
AboutYou
I couldnt
Help it
I said we’re dating
She knows we/re
We are right?
Maybe u
Dont think we are
And dont
Want to say it
Tell people
I feel nervous about
The whole thing now,
Its not like
I need u to
Tell ur parents
About me
But i think
It will feel bad
For me, meeting them
Being a mystery
girl.
I noticed
We did not say
I love u
When i left today
U did not say it
And i said it
Last night and
I didnt want to be
The one
To say it first
Twice
And i could maybe see

In ur eyes
That you were
Thinking about it
And it felt
Intentional
That u didn’t.
You said,
You shouldn’t have said it
Well i dont know what’s right
What should be said
Shouldnt be said
Theres a lot of
Things
That are painful about this,
You being with me
Is painful for you,
For me,
And for her,
Painful because the 3
Of us know youre still
Missing her,
So maybe it should not have happened
But it felt way too good
Too right
To resist it.
So now its good bad good and bad again
All mixed up
Good
Bad
Good
Bad
Who knows what's
Wrong
Right.
I wrote some poems the other night
They feel like too much to show you
This one feels like too much to show you
I feel frustrated
That you
Made it your quest to
Get me
But you knew
Know
Its not the right time

And I feel Doom
I feel a pit
In my stomach
When you say
You see yourself
Getting back with her
What
Am
I
Supposed
To
Do
With
That?
Should I
Stop all of this
Detach from U
Out of caution, even though
It feels good to be
With you
Or should try to ignore it
Forget about it
Stop thinking about
How it feels like i will be
So
Hurt
In the future.
​
U dont have any
Of the answers
We go in
Circles
I dont have any of the answers
We go in
Spirals
Sinking down
And getting dizzy
Having nothing to say
Having sex again
Cause it feels good
I went to whole foods
And bought
Grapes
And started swallowing them
Like i saw in some tv show

Where a girl has to practice
Swallowing capsules of
Cocaine
To smuggle them across the border
Except i though id use them
For practice
Gulping down all the
Hard Pills To Swallow
That i keep
Getting prescribed
By you
In your little
Fucked up
Confusing
Pharmacy.
U look so evil
But so hot
Like an evil genius
In your lab coat
Serena 5?
I am so annoyed at
you.
you exiled me from my
own room
all weekend
and you
weren’t even that nice
to me,
in fact,
you were kind of mean.
and you said you
would put my room
back together
but
it’s all
fucked
and there are sequins
everywhere
including IN MY BED
and it’s making me
so.
mad.

and when I went
to put on my
string lights on
last night
I realized you had
taken them
down
and they’re all tangled
and fucked
and you messed up all the
power strips too
and I was too upset
to fix them
too upset
to move
so I sat under
the Overhead Light
and everyone knows
it does not
feel good
to sit under the
Overhead Light

Crazy Girl
I read ur
Poem

Feel
Pretty,.,.
,.,..,.,So
Bad
Me and Luca
Decided
I should distance myself
From you
After reading it
That poem you wrote
It nearly
Doomed
You,.
Nearly doomed
us,.
But then today
We talked
And I spent time
With you

And I couldn’t do it
And I didn’t want to
And I told you
The truth
That It was intentional
That I didn’t say
I love you
When you left
Cuz I can’t
Right now
And cuz it’s freaking me
Out
And you were
Okay with that,,
And we talked
And had a great
Afternoon,,and
I hope you’ll store that
In your head
For when you say
I only wanna hangout at night
And fuck you,,
Though,
When the sun went down
We did fuck
And I held
You
And it felt so good
It felt so good
I couldn’t help but cum
I tried to hold on
Longer
But I couldn’t help it,
I came.
I been coming
So .,.,.,
.,.,,. Too
Fast
The past 3 or 4
Times we had
Sex,

But lately
I just can’t help,
I just can’t hold back,
I just can’t help
But feel so good
And let it all
happen.

Hair 4
I was starting to
Hate it;
I was starting
To hate myself :
When
I looked at myself
It looked
So bad
And I can’t
Love myself when
I look bad,.
So I got the two of you
To cut it:
The both of you
You towered over me
Considering, and consulting
One another
For every move,.
And I loved the two of you
Caring for me
And for my head,,
I trusted you,.
Both of you,.
I knew you could
Make it work,.
And you did ;
And my hair looks
So good
So much
​ Better now, and

I feel so much
​ Better now, and
Thanks for
​
Doing it,
Cuz now
My ego is back
And I can
Love myself
Again.

Acting Class 4
I did my final scene
Today
In my acting class
And everyone
Laughed a lot
And it made me
Feel so good
To make all them
Feel so good,.
Afterwards we all gave eachother
Comments
And they all jacked me off
So hard,.
Telling me how
Effortlessly funny
How great I was
And I really started to believe it
All ,
And later that night
Me and Adeline
Watched the open mic
Comedy at
The Bebop,,
And everyone was so prepared
And it all blended together,
It wasn’t bad
To the point where it was funny

It wasn’t good
To the point where it was funny,,
It was mostly,
Nothing,.
But Adeline said,
She said,
She thinks I could
Go up there
And just talk
And be effortlessly funny
And this keeps coming up
And maybe they’re all right
And I’m always wondering
Dreaming
That it could be enough
To speak my honest thoughts
And I had this sneaking suspicion on
My own,.
But now
After hearing everyone else say
It,.
Makes me feel
Like I must be true
And I must be special!
And I got something!
And they’ll all worship me!
And I could be good!
And it could be so easy
Cuz All I’d have to do it
Be Myself
And It’s just like diary of
A Wimpy Kid where Rowly
Gets really popular even though
He’s a nerd , but he gets popular
Because he’s so unapologetically
Himself
And That Could Be Me
And I’m Rowly
But I might be Greg
But I ‘ll try to be Rowly
And to be Rowly

I must only
be Me
So I will
Be Me
And this Ending
Ain’t coming together
All that well
But I promise it’s all Me
Guyz I can’t help but just be me!
PLz accept me for what I am
Even if I can’t make a good ending right now,,
Isn’t it so quirky and comical how
I’m telling you that I can’t think of anything
To say,, Lol!! I’m so brave
And Honest
Ok Peace yall
Have a blessed Day!!!!
I love you
So i guess we’re back
To not saying it
​
Its ok to not say it

Machine Dreams
When the garbage man
comes around
to the alley
that your window looks out to
at 6 in the morning
i am woken up by machine noises.
Lots of mornings,
the noises get
incorporated
into my dreams,
and so
im used to having
machine dreams
when im at your place.
You like to sleep with
the window open,
and i let you open it,
even when
we’re at my place.
The open window only
intensifies my
machine dreams.
The other morning,
even before the machinery,
i was up
thinking about her and
feeling just so bad.
Sometimes it takes me

a while for the
sadness to sink in
throughout the day,
i wake up fine and then
by the time my day is done
i am fully
saturated.
But the other morning
i woke up soaked,
choking in it.
I must have dreamed myself
into a pool of guilt
and i woke up
sticky,
so cold,
window still open,
no machine noises yet.
I fell in and out of sleep,
waking up every so often and
trying to arrange your
sleeping body to a
position where you could
hold me, but
it doesn't stay in place,
even though
you talked in your sleep
the other evening
and told me
“i’ll do whatever you want”
Serena 6
You were in my room
It’s filled with
Glitter
Red hearts
Little silver stars
They stick to my feet
When i walk
Barefoot
In our place.
I got love on the
Bottom of my feet
For you.
The glitter is even

In my bed.
I like being in ur
Bed with you
When you let me lay
I feel good
I feel lighter
we are girls together
Love,adeline
Serena 7
I’m Glad I
Met you,.
You
Were my God
I almost
Had sex with
God once,.
Remember
When I massaged
Your butt,
I mounted you.,..
I’m not sure if
Your still my
God,.
I think you could
Take it back
If you’d just
TELL ME WHAT TO DO
I NEED
SOMEONE
TO.

It’s a horrible thing to name a poem after the time, so I won’t
It’s 5:47 in the morning,
I stayed up
All through the night
Working on my final
Project for my production
Class,,

It’s a music production class
And I spent a while
Mixing my songs,,
But what really got me
Was that we had to have a
Visual representation
So I decided to make a
Zine,,, and I spent way more
Time on it than I should’ve or
Than I needed to
But I couldn’t stop
And it was so fun,
And sometimes
I get in this mode
Where I want something
To be so good because I know
I could make it so good and I
Can’t stop until I get there,.
Though now I can feel my body will
Be a bit destroyed today
And slowly
Crumble apart.
I don’t even
Feel like sleeping
Now,.
I took my adderall
Incrementally
Throughout the day
I even took a bit at midnight
So I’m fully awake;
I wonder when my body
Will have to
Pay the price
For all the tricks
I’m playing..
N ow since I’m not tired
I was gonna work on this
Poetry final assignment.
We’re supposed to

Revise all our poems
That we wrote
Throughout the semester.
I’m having a hard time,
I guess I should’ve just written
Bad poems, because these poems
Are good, and there’s nothing
Worth changing or that
Needs changing.,
But I do it for u
Pat
Cuz I’m a good boy.
And I wonder if you think I’m
A bad boy
Cuz I wrote some bad poems,.
Some real 3vil ones and I
Even read them for the class..
But if you really knew me,,
If you really read
My poems,
If you ever really listened,,
Then you’d know:
I’m no bad boy,
I just like pretending.

My Life is Starting Over Again 3?4?
I don’t feel
Like ending
The book,
I don’t
Have much
Good words,
I don’t
Have the
Right words
To sum it
All up
To feel good

About
Everything.
But school is
Ending
Summer’s
Beginning
You’re
Going away
For 2 months
So I have 2 days
To sum it all up
To tie it up
All nice and
Pretty,
I hope I come up
With something
So that
I can feel like
Everything
Is good
And right
And in it’s
Place
But if I
Don’t
At least
I warned you.

My Last HomeWork
Assignment Ever
Or

“Students will compose an analytical essay situating a work in historical context on a
artists or band or particular composition focusing on place in history, innovations other
styles that influenced chosen artist or band. Additionally, placing each into social,
cultural, and aesthetic context with specific reference to musical features.”
I was supposed to
Be working on it
All day.
My parents are here
For graduation and
I’m supposed to spend my
Time with them
But, I can’t: because
I have to finish
My Last HomeWork
Assignment Ever.
But I didn’t start till
3,
Because I got all
Distracted
I got lost
Ravenously
Collaging
In my
Journal
And playing
Guitar.
And I kept
Telling myself:

​
It’s best
​
To begin
​
At the top
​
Of the hour;
​
(On an
​
Even number)
​
and Now it’s 4:24
And all I wrote
Was a introduction
Paragraph.
This happens all
The time
When I have work to do:
When I get all hyper
And drink
Coffee and take
Adderall to do it:
All I wanna do
Is make art
And play guitar
Because it feels
So good and I can’t stop
And it’s all I wanna do,,
But my dad reminded me yesterday
Once I move to New York
Next year,
I can spend a year or two
Working
Random jobs,,
Performing,,,
“Being an artist”.,..
See if it works out,.
And if it doesn’t,
Then , he says ,
I can reflect
And then,,.
I’ll
go back
To work.

And now I will
Ttyl.

Deandre hopkins cup (football reference)
I have this
Plastic
Texans
Cup , that I like to
Drink
Out of,.
I can feel myself swallowing
All the micro
Plastics everytime-i
Drink it
Getting more
And more
infertile
But it feels
Good
to pretend
I’m proud
Of
Where I
Come from.
My Mom ( the complaining legend boy 1)
Does this thing
Where she
Says something
To someone
And laughs so
Forcefully hard
Right after
To elicit
A laugh
Reaction
From her
Conversation
Partner
And I feel

So sad
For her
Everytime
She does it,.
I really hope
I never do that.
My Dad ( the complaining legend boy 2)
Hates it,
orders me to
Stop,
Everytime
I start
Fingerboarding
Or else
He says
He will
Break it
In half
And
Sometimes
I wish
He just would
So I could
Have a reason
To be
Upset at him
And
Sometimes
I just wish
He could
Like it
Too.
The Complaining Legend Boy 3 (he is me)
Heer ye heer ye
It is me
The complaining legend boy scotty

To complain,.

Find it awfully
Dull
To listen to
Certain people do it,
However;

It sounded too good
To not write it.

Just
Look up
A complaint
I have
Then write reddit

For example:
“Citationmachine.net has way to many ads its so annoying reddit”
Just because
I want

With me.

poems I wrote on the plane to london

Hyper
let’s get hyper
when I get back
we can wake up
early
i’ll do it
for u

we’ll get up early
i’ll do
whatever drugs
you do
and we’ll get up
make so much
art
feel so good
make eachother
good
we’ll make a video
where we each have
6 heads
and our bodies r
GLITTERING
and there are
creatures
around us that
watch us
as we play guitar
and we’re in a field
or a fort
I loved that one
time we made a fort

in your bed
I said I loved forts
so you made one
around us
and I felt
good,
like a kid,
and we had sex
anyway,
we’d make the video
and then we could just
lie
on our backs
in the sun
until another idea
came to us
of something else to
create,
and the ideas
would keep coming
and we’d make
paper mache faces
and write poems
on the inside

so no one but us
could read
know
them
we’d publish the book
and it would look
all
cool
and we’d make
a
little potion
that could
erase the memory of
any person
who read it
so that I could
clear my conscious
and not feel bad
not feel judgement
and i’m sorry
this poem
is very similar to you
Best Day Ever poem
but I got

excited
thinking about it
imagining
and I
miss you
and I have to
get it out.

itsmyalonetimeadventure

i’m going on
my adventure now
serena thinks it
will make me grow
and i’m excited
to grow
it’s time to seclude
myself
I always have a hard
time doing it.
it always feels too good
to be with someone
but i’m secluding myself
i’m going places
where

no one knows me
I have no enemies
I have no lovers
I have no friends
I have no family
I am fresh
I am blank
and i’m secluding
myself from You,
I want to tell you
all the details, I must
decide what to tell you
i’ll want to text you
everything
and i’m going to learn
how to be
my own person
existing outside
the context i’ve built
around me

Our Adventure
it lasted
February 29th - May 12th

it was mostly
so
good.
thank you.
and now,
intermission

The end
You’re gone
Off to
Europe
I’m alone
Here at home
And
Strangely,
I find myself
Settling into
My Sanity,,
Which is the last thing I need,
To write
A compelling
Ending,.
But ,
As I sat tonight
Unsure
Of what to do,.
I decided
That I must
End this
Chapter
Before I begin
The next,,
So this: ,,
This will be

The end
The last
words,,
Whether
It is good or
bad

Why I began
Writing this
I don’t know,,,
If I’ll continue writing,,
I don’t know,,
I haven’t written
For a week
And thinking about it
Makes me feel sick
And I am sick
And I’ve been sick
For two weeks..
But maybe,
Maybe I’ll I need is
To finish this
Before I
Can begin
Anything else
It’s been
A crazy
Time,.
The
Craziest
Time
Of my life
I did a lot of things,.
/We did a lot of things,,
Good
​
And some bad,,
Mostly good
( Like you said,.)

But now
We seclude ourselves
And venture
Into the darkness
I don’t know
What we will
Find
But I hope
I can learn
Something
And I hope it
Will show
Me where to go.,.,
God ,.
I hate to be
The last one here,
The last poem,
The last words,.,.
I don’t feel like
I can say anything
Really.
If I was a person
Who read this all,,
Which
Is a very low
Likelihood
,,;
I would want to feel joy
I would want to feel inspired..,
To the reader,,
I’ll say this,,
If you read this
If you cared
Then right there is proof,,
That you too
Can get away
With it,,
If you just

​
​
Speak your
​
​
Mind
​
Honestly
​
With
​
​
Dramatic
​
Spacing,,
Maybe,.
​
​
Someone
Will care,.
And if my plain
​
Morbid
​
unfiltered
​
Thoughts felt important
To you,,
Then I guess thats proof
​
That anyone’s could be
Important,,
​
Because
​
I may have spent time
​
Typing
​
The words that came to
​
My brain,,
But this whole thing
​
Took
​
Little to no
​
Mental stretching
​
Whatsoever
​
So you could do it too
If you just ​
​
Wanted to.
If you just
​
Needed to.

And
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
​

To Adeline,,
I knew
From the moment you
Started being
In my classes
Over and over
I knew

In drum
​
Class,,
​
​
I knew, . there was something
​
I prayed
​
​
There was something
​
And I feel
​
So lucky
​
​
​
That there was
Anything
​
At all,,
I’m sorry
​
If I love
​
Bombed
You,,
But the idea of you
​
Being at all
Interested in me,,
​
I was
​
Obsessed,,
With you
​
​
From such a
Distance
​
​
From just
Glancing
​
​
At you,.
:

It blew my mind.

And to learn ,
​
You,..,
To learn ​
Your brain
​
Just made it all
Somehow
​
Better
And
​
I believe in
​
You,,
I know
​
There’s something

​
Twisted
​
In there ,there’s something
​
I can’t stop
Listening to
​
And looking
​
At
And I wish
​
​
You were here
​
I wish you were laying
​
Right there
On my bed,,
​
I wish
​
We could talk,,
But ,.
​
​

On a final
Thought
What I’ll say to you

What I think
​
You want to hear.,.,,.
Well.,,
​
​
,.,.Something
That you want to hear
That I’d want to hear too,,
​
​
​
​
​
​

Is that you are doing enough
And what you do:,​
I think it’s important
And I think you must keep doing it
And I think your better
Than them all

And I hope one day
​
​
​
You and me both
Could convince each other
​
Of this truth
Or fail,
​
And just
Accept it all and chose
​
Love

​
​

instead.
